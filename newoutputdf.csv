"1",1,"The Party",1,122,"4/3/2024","My phone buzzed. I rolled over to look at the text my cousin Maya had just sent.

Can you send photo you took of all the girls in costume last night? xoxo

My head was throbbing. Hanging out with Maya was fun, but she was eight years younger than me and she and her friends loved to do shots. I needed to stick with beer only if I didn’t want the hangover.

That’s what I'd do next time.

I opened my photos app to find the picture Maya had requested. It was a group shot I had no memory of taking. It wasn’t everyone who’d been at the party - just the girls who’d dressed up, all five of them smiling cheesily. The starlet, the busybody, the social climber, the professor, and the old lady - everyone dressed to impress. The most incredible costume, by far, was worn by a girl named Lee who was a stranger to this group, the new girlfriend of Maya’s friend Patrick. She was a gorgeous girl in her twenties, but she’d come wearing make-up on her face that aged her fifty years.

The photo of the girls wasn’t great - there was a weird glare off of Maya’s microwave or something - but I sent it, and then began to scroll through the other recent photos. I had no memory of any of them.

It was a problem. I mean, I didn’t have a problem problem, and everyone had gotten a little sloppy last night. But Maya’s boyfriend Matthew had to get me an Uber - I was too drunk to drive home - and that was embarrassing.

There were photos of Maya and Matthew being adorable; a few selfies of me with others, which were mortifying, since my make-up had smeared without me knowing; and one photo of a dead body.

I deleted that one - it was blurry - and rolled over to go back to sleep.

*****

The idea of a murder mystery party had sounded corny to me at first, but Maya was great at selling the idea of a good time.

“It’ll be hilarious,” she promised me over drinks a few weeks ago. “I’ve got dibs on being Josephine La Rosa, the movie star, though, so you can’t take that one.”

I’d never been to a murder mystery party before, but Maya had explained the concept. Everyone was given a dramatic role to play, an entirely new identity for the evening. One of us would serve as the moderator, handing out index cards telling people different things they needed to say and do throughout the evening. There would be one card given to a character instructing them to pretend they’d been killed. The remainder of the evening would involve all the players trying to sort through the clues and solve the murder.

I didn’t want to participate. “I’m not really into role play,” I told Maya. She wiggled her eyebrows at me, making me laugh. “You know what I mean - dressing up, acting.”

“You have to do it,” she insisted. I got a vision of Maya as a high school student. She was skilled in the art of peer pressure.

Of course, we didn’t go to high school at the same time. When I was in high school, getting bullied by the popular girls and trying to keep my head down, Maya was in grade school. My other cousin - Maya’s older brother Stephen - was a year ahead of me in school. We were friends back then, but I didn’t see him much these days. He was married, with two kids who were the kind of adorable that made me ache. I didn’t like thinking about Stephen and his perfect family.

“I’ll come,” I promised Maya. “But I’m not dressing up.”

*****

Before the party, I’d made a rule for myself - no beer, only liquor. I had a tendency to pound beers but was better at slowly sipping a mixed drink.

A party like this was literally my worst nightmare. Every other girl was confident, impressive in their role. Maya was an effervescent Hollywood starlet. Her three closest girlfriends - Molly, Miranda, and Tess - had clearly gotten ready altogether, and their costumes were spectacular. They were a close-knit group, and it made me miss my closest girlfriends, who I didn’t see as much these days.

It was when Lee entered that I started to feel overwhelmed. There was a flurry of activity when she walked in with Patrick, the girls oohing and aahing at her costume and make-up, Maya’s buddy Aaron grabbing her cane and poking her with it flirtatiously.

“So nice to meet you all,” Lee had croaked in a faux old lady voice. Why were some girls so beautiful that they could twist their faces gruesomely and still grab the attention of every guy in the room?

Even Matthew stared at her, his mouth agape, when she entered. I elbowed him, which seemed to snap him out of it.

“She’s hot, but you have a girlfriend who’s my cousin,” I’d whispered to him.

Matthew had shaken his head, grinning back at me. We got along well. From our converations, I knew that he had also been an ugly duckling in high school. Maya had shown me his old yearbook, laughing affectionately at his bowtie and buck teeth. With a bit of dental work and a six figure job, he was now a catch and had the confidence that went with it.

That stung a little. Ugly ducklings can either grow into swans, or into sloppy ducks like me.

*****

The next time my phone buzzed, I was still in bed, even though it was nearly noon. It was Maya again. She always sprang right out of bed after a night of drinking. That was the difference between twenty-seven and thirty-five.

She was sobbing.

“Lee is dead,” she said, her voice quiet and trembling.

I laughed. Lee had been a fantastic murder victim the night before. Really, what was she not good at? Matthew had handed her the index card - he’d fixed his staring problem by then, just smiled briefly at her - and she’d disappeared into Maya’s bathroom to splay herself out on the tile floor. When we discovered her, she was covered in red, having stolen a bottle of ketchup from the refrigerator for added effect.

“No, no, Amy.”

I paused.

“Really dead,” Maya said. “Patrick just called from the hospital. She’s dead.”

*****

An hour later, the eight of us - all the murder mystery party attendees, except for Lee - were at the police station.

Maya was a wreck. I was trying not to throw up. I’d taken a shot of tequila before I left for the police station. Madness, maybe, but it was all I’d had in the house - my little effort at moderating, since tequila hurt my stomach. The other girls were crying. Aaron and Matthew were stone-faced.

We saw Patrick, down the hallway with an officer, too far away to see his face.

We weren’t supposed to speak to each other, and we were quickly separated. Maya looked at me longingly as a female police officer escorted her to a private room.

“Ma’am?”

I looked up.

“Can you come with me?”

The room looked just like the ones I’d seen on TV - a large window, a rectangular table, two empty wooden chairs. I stared at the officer. “Is this an investigation?”

He was older - maybe my father’s age, with graying hair and rosy cheeks. He nodded. “Precautionary, I’m sure,” he said. “I’m Officer Myers.”

“How did she die?” I asked.

Officer Myers narrowed his eyes at me. “No one told you?”

I shook my head. “Patrick didn’t tell Maya.”

“Ms. Latour, have you been drinking?”

I could feel my face turn red. “It’s been - it was a late night, and then the news -”

He was frowning at me, sternly - the way Dad used to. “Can you tell me anything about the end of the evening - the goodbyes?”

“Don’t you want to know about the murder?”

Officer Myers stared at me, and I flushed again. “Ms. Latour, no one has said anything about a murder, and you just told me you don’t know how Ms. Imogene Monroe -”

“Who?”

I regretted my question instantly. This officer didn’t like to be interrupted.

“Imogene Monroe is the woman who died right after attending a party you also attended, Ms. Latour.”

My mouth felt dry. “I didn’t know - she said her name was Lee. I never met her before last night.” Officer Myers continued to stare at me.

Everything was all wrong.

When I’m nervous, I drink. If I can’t drink, I babble incessantly.

“Did she - was it a car accident? She had a bit to drink, but not as much as Patrick.” I closed my eyes, picturing them at the door of Maya’s house. Patrick was slumped and sloppy, not that I’m one to talk, but Lee had seemed just fine. She had smiled at me and thanked me. Why had she thanked me? “I gave her a bottle of water, for the road,” I added, remembering.

It was the wrong thing to say. Officer Myers tried to keep his expression neutral, but his mustache twitched and I could hear his foot start to tap beneath the table.

“Ms. Latour,” he said quietly. “Do you have anyone you can call?”

*****

There wasn’t anyone to call. My mother had left me and Dad when I was a kid. A year ago, I could have called Dad, but he’d just been moved into an assisted living facility a few months ago after receiving his diagnosis. Early onset Alzheimer’s, just like my grandfather. Dad was in his fifties when we found out. Now, he was sixty-three, and he didn’t know who I was half the time when I went to visit. I didn’t visit him much, honestly. It was too hard to see him the way he was.

The only person I wanted to talk to was Maya, but Officer Myers explained that she was being questioned down the hall and us communicating wasn’t an option.

There was a phone in the room with us. There was only one person I could think of to call, and I really didn’t want to call him. I took my cell phone from my pocket.

“I can’t let you look through your phone,” Officer Myers said sternly.

“I just need to look up a number,” I said. “My cousin Stephen.” He watched me carefully. When I unlocked the phone, it was the photo of Maya, Lee, and the other three girls that popped up first. I quickly clicked away from it and found Stephen’s number, then dialed it on the station phone.

“Amy? Are you okay?”

My eyes filled wih tears. My last interaction with Stephen had been awful. Yelling. Accusations. I wasn’t a good daughter. His father was taking care of Dad the way I should be doing. I don’t know what I expected today, but his voice was concerned and caring.

“I don’t know. I need a lawyer. I think I’m in trouble.”

“You are. Don’t react - I’m sure you’re not alone.”

My eyes shifted to Officer Myers.

“Maya already called me. I don’t think they’ve figured that out yet, so keep cool, okay?” Stephen was a surgeon, and as he spoke I could picture him in the OR - giving instructions confidently, in his element, knowing what to say and do in ways I never did.

It wasn’t always like this. In high school, Stephen was a jock who partied and I was bookish and intelligent. I had a nearly photographic memory, a straight A average, and multiple college scholarship offers. I didn’t even drink until college. Then after college, when Dad started looking right through me when we talked, I started having a beer with dinner every night to take the edge off. One a day led to two, then six, and then a decade passed and Stephen was a hot shot and I was barely able to remember what happened at a freaking murder mystery party that I wouldn’t have attended if I was a normal thirty-five-year-old with a steady job and a family and a moderate amount of self-esteem.

“Amy? Amy!”

“I’m here,” I said quickly. “Can you find the number for the attorney?”

“Good girl. Listen, it’s the waters.”

Was he speaking in code? “Stephen?”

“The waters you gave out as Lee and the others were leaving,” Stephen said. “She had a peanut allergy, and there were traces of peanut in the bottle she drank out of. She didn’t open it until she stopped driving. Patrick woke up in the passenger seat and she was going into anaphylactic shock. No epipen in her purse, either, and Patrick swore that she always had one on her.”

My head was spinning. “So now -”

“My wife’s dad is an attorney - he’s retired, but he’ll have someone down there in twenty minutes, Ames.” He hadn’t called me that in such a long time. “Ames? They don’t have any motive, okay? They’ll release you. Just hang tight.”

I nodded.

“Ames?”

“Yeah - yes. Stephen, you didn’t ask me -”

“I don’t need to ask you anything. You didn’t do this. Stay cool and we’ll be right there.”

*****

The only person who’d ever accused me of having a drinking problem was Stephen, and I denied it. I was a crappy daughter and a lousy cousin and friend, and I liked to party, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. Yeah, I drank when I was sad, and yeah, sometimes things got messy, but I was functional. I had a job, and I paid my bills, and I’d never gotten a DUI or passed out in a ditch or anything like that.

Yet as I sat there, waiting for my cousin to save me from the mess I’d created, I couldn’t deny that drinking had contributed to my predicament. I’d been a hungover mess all day, and not thinking straight.

I used to be the girl with the level head, the girl who could think through any problem, the girl who did logic puzzles for fun. I’d been solving the Hidden Pictures puzzles from Highlights magazine ever since I was four years old -

It hit me suddenly. My head had been throbbing all day, but I forced myself to concentrate.

There was something I’d seen. Or was it something someone had said? Or both?

There was a knock at the door. An officer entered - the one I’d seen with Maya earlier - with a woman I’d never seen before.

“Ms. Latour, come with me.”

I rose, but I didn’t leave the room. Officer Myers had stepped in my path. “What the -”

“Amber Griffin, Ms. Latour’s attorney. You don’t have the evidence to hold her, sir.”

They started to bicker, the officers and my attorney, and I bent forward, tucking my head between my legs and placing my hands over my ears to muffle the noise.

*****

It was Miranda who murdered Lee - or rather, the professor who fake murdered the old lady, which we found out toward the end of our murder mystery party evening. Everyone dissolved in laughter when it was revealed, mostly because Miranda is such a sweetheart.

Matthew was the one who solved it. He wasn’t drinking at all, which I think helped. He’d had one mixed drink while he, Maya, and I were prepping for the party, but nothing after the other guests had all arrived.

“It’s because she was cruel to me in high school,” I remembered Miranda saying, giggling, almost apologizing to Lee for the affront. “Lee’s character. That was in our back stories. She used to bully me every day, so when I saw her as a grown-up, I snapped.”

By this point in the night, I was incredibly drunk, but those words stood out to me. To Matthew, too, I could tell. We knew what it was like to be bullied. The stories Matthew had told me over the past three years - the ways he’d been tormented.

It was enough to push anyone over the edge.

*****

There was something that was eluding me. A memory. A visual.

If I can figure this out, I thought, I’ll never drink again.

It wasn’t just about my freedom, which I could tell was in jeopardy. Of course, I was terrified. I hadn’t done anything to hurt anyone, and I wanted desperately to go home.

More than that, though, I wanted to conquer my memory, my brain. I wanted my mind to be my own again. How many times had I lost my thoughts, my memories, been unable to retrieve something from the corners of my mind?

When everything clicked into place, I lifted my head and looked at Officer Myers and my attorney, who stopped arguing and looked back.

“Did you have something to share, Ms. Latour?” Amber said quietly.

","

It was the reflection I’d seen in the photo I sent Maya that morning - a distraction from the five girls in the photograph. The combination of microwave and oven and a trick of the light, I supposed, because what I remembered right then was what I’d seen that morning but not registered as important in my half-drunk, half-hungover state.

A vision of Matthew, an open water bottle in one hand, his other fist closed tightly around something.

It wasn’t proof. I had no idea if they’d even believe me. I was still in a lot of trouble.

Yet I felt satisfied, the way anyone would feel when they find something - their keys, a fact, a memory - that they’d thought was lost forever.

“There’s a photo on my phone,” I said quietly. “Passcode 5560, my dad’s birthday. You need to see it.”","I nodded, my heart pounding. ""I think I know what happened.""

Officer Myers raised an eyebrow. ""Go on.""

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my thoughts. ""Last night, during the party, Miranda said something about her character being bullied by Lee's character in high school. It was part of their backstory for the game.""

Amber nodded, encouraging me to continue.

""Matthew and I, we both know what it's like to be bullied. We talked about it a lot. He was really affected by it, even though he doesn't show it. And last night, he was the one who solved the fake murder. He was the one who handed out the index cards.""

Officer Myers frowned. ""Are you suggesting Matthew had something to do with Lee's death?""

I shook my head. ""Not directly. But he was the one who gave her the water bottle. I remember now. He handed it to me and asked me to give it to her. He knew about her peanut allergy. He must have known.""

Amber's eyes widened. ""Are you saying Matthew tampered with the water bottle?""

I nodded slowly. ""I think so. He must have put something in it, knowing it would trigger her allergy. He wanted to get back at her for the bullying, even if it was just a game.""

Officer Myers looked skeptical. ""That's a serious accusation, Ms. Latour. Do you have any proof?""

I hesitated, then pulled out my phone. ""I have a photo. The one with all the girls in costume. There's a weird glare in the background, but if you look closely, you can see Matthew handing me the water bottle. It's blurry, but it's there.""

Officer Myers took my phone and examined the photo. His expression hardened. ""We'll need to investigate this further.""

Amber placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. ""You've done the right thing, Amy. We'll get to the bottom of this.""

As they led me out of the room, I felt a strange mix of relief and dread. I had uncovered the truth, but it came at a cost. Matthew, the man who had seemed so kind and understanding, had harbored a darkness I hadn't seen.

And as I walked out of the police station, I made a silent vow to myself. No more drinking. No more losing control. I would reclaim my life, my mind, and my memories. One step at a time.","<brainstorm>
1. **Matthew's Involvement**: Matthew, Maya's boyfriend, could be the one who tampered with the water bottles. He might have had a hidden motive, such as jealousy or a past connection with Lee.
2. **Maya's Secret**: Maya could have known about Lee's peanut allergy and, in a fit of jealousy or anger, tampered with the water bottle.
3. **Lee's Hidden Past**: Lee might not be who she claimed to be. She could have had a hidden past that someone at the party knew about and wanted to silence her.
4. **Accidental Tampering**: The tampering could have been accidental. Someone might have used a knife that had traces of peanut butter on it to open the water bottle.
5. **Stephen's Role**: Stephen could have a hidden connection to Lee, and his involvement in the case might be more than just familial concern.

The best idea seems to be combining elements of Matthew's involvement and Lee's hidden past. This would provide a surprising twist and recontextualize earlier events, especially Matthew's behavior and the murder mystery party dynamics.
</brainstorm>

""Did you have something to share, Ms. Latour?"" Amber said quietly.

I took a deep breath, my mind racing through the fragments of memories from the night before. ""Yes,"" I said, my voice steady. ""I remember something about the water bottles.""

Officer Myers and Amber exchanged glances. ""Go on,"" Officer Myers prompted.

""Matthew was the one who handed out the water bottles,"" I said slowly, piecing it together. ""He was the only one who wasn't drinking, and he was very insistent on making sure everyone had water before they left.""

Amber nodded, encouraging me to continue. ""And?""

""And Lee... or Imogene, she thanked me for the water, but I didn't give it to her. Matthew did. He was the one who knew about her peanut allergy.""

Officer Myers frowned. ""How would he know that?""

""Because Lee wasn't just some random girl,"" I said, the realization hitting me. ""She was someone from Matthew's past. He used to be bullied in high school, and Lee was one of his tormentors. She didn't recognize him because of his transformation, but he never forgot her.""

Amber's eyes widened. ""So you're saying Matthew had a motive?""

""Yes,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""He wanted revenge. He saw the murder mystery party as the perfect cover. He tampered with the water bottle, knowing she would drink it later. He even made sure Patrick was too drunk to notice anything.""

Officer Myers looked skeptical but intrigued. ""That's a serious accusation, Ms. Latour.""

""I know,"" I said, my eyes meeting his. ""But it's the truth. Check the guest list from their high school reunion. You'll find Imogene Monroe and Matthew's old name. He changed it after high school.""

Amber turned to Officer Myers. ""You need to investigate this. If what Ms. Latour is saying is true, then Matthew had both the motive and the opportunity.""

Officer Myers nodded slowly. ""We'll look into it.""

As they left the room, I felt a strange sense of relief. The pieces had finally fallen into place. I wasn't just a sloppy drunk; I was someone who could still solve puzzles, who could still think clearly when it mattered.

And as I sat there, waiting for the next steps, I made a silent promise to myself: I would never let my mind get clouded again. I would reclaim my life, one sober day at a time.

The door opened, and Stephen walked in, his face a mix of concern and relief. ""Ames, are you okay?""

I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ""I think I will be, Stephen. I think I will be.""

Officer Myers frowned. ""What are you getting at, Ms. Latour?""

I closed my eyes, focusing on the memory that had been nagging at me. ""Matthew and I used to talk a lot about our high school experiences. He was bullied, too. He told me stories about how cruel some of the girls were to him.""

Amber's eyes widened as she began to understand. ""Are you saying Matthew had a personal vendetta?""

I nodded. ""Yes. And I remember something else. When Lee arrived at the party, Matthew stared at her. Not just because she was beautiful, but because he recognized her.""

Officer Myers leaned forward, his interest piqued. ""Recognized her from where?""

""From high school,"" I said, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks. ""Lee wasn't just a random girl. She was one of the girls who bullied Matthew.""

The room fell silent as the weight of my words sank in. Amber turned to Officer Myers. ""You need to investigate this further. If Matthew had a motive and recognized Lee, he could have tampered with the water bottles.""

Officer Myers nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful. ""We'll look into it.""

As they left the room, I felt a strange mix of relief and dread. I had uncovered a crucial piece of the puzzle, but it also meant that someone I cared about might be responsible for Lee's death.

*****

Hours later, I was released from the police station. Stephen and Amber were waiting for me outside, their faces filled with concern.

""Are you okay?"" Stephen asked, pulling me into a hug.

I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ""I think so. Thank you for helping me.""

Amber smiled reassuringly. ""You did great in there, Amy. You remembered something crucial.""

As we walked to Stephen's car, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Matthew had always been kind to me, but now I saw him in a different light. The pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place, but the picture they formed was one of betrayal and hidden darkness.

As we drove away, I made a silent vow to myself. I would get my life back on track. No more drinking to escape my problems. I would face them head-on, with a clear mind and a determined heart.

And I would find out the truth about what happened to Lee, no matter how painful it might be."," As my head cleared from the fog of alcohol, a memory surfaced with an intensity that was almost painful: Lee's words about Miranda and her cruel past in high school. I remembered them as if they were spoken moments ago, not days ago at our murder mystery party.

""Yes,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil within me. ""Miranda killed Lee.""

I could see the surprise flicker across their faces before confusion set in. They didn't understand how I knew it was Miranda who had committed the fake murder during our game night earlier that evening. It wasn't just the pieces of the puzzle fitting together; it was a revelation about human behavior, empathy, and retribution.

""Miranda confessed to me,"" I continued, my words gaining strength with each syllable. ""She said she killed Lee because Lee used to bully her in high school.""

The officers exchanged glances, their earlier confidence now replaced by uncertainty. Amber's hand moved subtly to the radio at her waist before she spoke again, her tone more assertive this time. ""We will need to verify that information and speak with Miranda ourselves, but you are being released from custody on my advice.""

As I stood there, a weight lifted off my shoulders, not just because of the impending release, but because I had conquered something within myself. The fog of alcohol was no longer clouding my mind; instead, clarity replaced confusion and fear with determination.

I understood now that while drinking might have been a contributing factor to this chaotic evening, it wasn't the root cause. It was my desire for control, understanding, and order in a world filled with uncertainty. I had sought solace in alcohol, but tonight, I found strength in confronting the truth head-on without drowning myself in drinks.

With this newfound clarity, I knew what I had to do next: never let alcohol control my actions again. From this moment forward, I would take charge of my life and decisions, relying on reason rather than intoxication. It was a dauntinng journey ahead but one that felt necessary for not just the sake of freedom from legal troubles but also to reclaim myself - mind, body, and soul.

And so, as I left the police station with Amber Griffin by my side, a sense of purpose filled me. This was more than an end; it was a beginning – a chance for redemption, growth, and self-improvement. My journey to reclaim myself had just started, and nothing would stand in my way now that I had conquered the chaos within my mind.","z p h f"

It feels odd. Narrating things like this, not speaking, just thinking. Is it even…yeah, it’s working. Um…so, they said this would be a way to fix things, explore all the things I thought I knew. See things from a different perspective and all that. When I was accepted to the Ruminate pioneer program, I was really happy. Jace and Clara begged me not to go, but I told them I needed this. It was only four months, after all. At the very least, I could be a pioneer, you know? It’ll take a few days to prepare but I'll write again when I’m in. Wish me luck.

The dive wasn’t so bad. I got pretty sick for the first few hours, but they said that was likely to happen. Luckily, the vomit didn’t transfer along with me. The timer started this morning and they were very adamant about it. Four months from this morning. September 13th, got it.

Today was the first day I was able to walk around and explore. The air here is thick and heavy, like I’m wading through molasses. There’s nothing but warmth and color as far as I can see so far, but my instructions are to go further in over the next two days. I think this was the right decision. I wasn’t sure what to expect but, I feel…better here. Like missing parts of me have come back.

Time isn’t quite the same here, the alerts that signal the days passing are so far apart, days and weeks pass before I hear the announcement in my head. 117 days remain. That will take some getting used to. Nevertheless, this place is amazing. The rivers are crystalline and the trees bleed color down their trunks. The sky is night and day simultaneously and I don’t even really need to walk to get around. It’s beautiful but it’s all so…empty, although I guess from the start I knew it would be.

The world is finally beginning to react to me now. I didn’t think it’d eat up so much time, but I guess that’s why this is an alpha test. Its boundaries morph and bifurcate, leading me to new paths - or old ones, I suppose. It’s letting me in. The murkiness of movement has become more refined. I no longer feel as though I’m wading through oil. I experienced the conception, which was as odd as you’d expect, but there was something poetic about it.

Transcription - 11:29am May 29th, 2318

The past few days have mostly been watching. It’s surreal to be a bystander here, to be able to explore but not alter. I know we can’t change the path here, only expand upon it. But, I’ve learned to slow the moments that matter to me. I can’t go back but at least I can spend time where it matters.

Transcription - 3:48pm June 2nd, 2318

I’m getting the hang of things, it doesn’t feel so lonely anymore. It’s frustrating to not be able to leave the bounds but at least I can relive all this. See it from a new perspective. It all feels so real. Like I could touch the grass and eat the food. Sometimes I swear I can when I watch them eat.

My parents and I talked for a long time, nothing they hadn’t said before, but it was still nice. I know it’s not really them, before you think I’ve lost sense of reality. It’s just…they were just how I remembered them - Dad still obsessed with his archaic motorcycle, Mom still asking a million questions. She kept asking about a girlfriend though, which I didn’t have - maybe mark that down on your side?

I spent too much of my time with Jace and Clara. We were just so inseparable back then. I feel like something changed after the accident. There was always a look of worry in their eyes after that.

Hey, team, really hoping you’re not dosing me up there… I’ve been experiencing - I don’t even know what to call it. Let’s say ‘flickers’. Every so often the world, er - the hippocampal environs have been shifting rapidly. I was with Jace and Clara - I was always with Jace and Clara - but Clara would skip and jitter, her voice would shift and muffle. The words would turn to gibberish. You know, for a moment back then, I thought Clara loved me. But seeing it back like this...it seemed like she hardly spoke to me.

Transcription - 5:55pm June 26th, 2318

Okay, I think I’ve had enough. This is becoming surreal and it’s not helping anymore. I came here to find out what’s wrong with me. To find a reason for feeling so empty, but this is just…this isn’t my life. There are seams, ripples of glass that surround every moment. Things have become so distorted, like I’m walking through a million mirrors repeating moments and reflecting them at me, omitting the things that aren’t caught in their perspective. I wanted answers and all I’m finding are dreams.

Transcription - 12:19pm July 3rd, 2318

Classes. Parties. Mistakes. - Happiness but less saturated. False without reason. I wanted so badly to relive it, to feel that joy again in this world you’ve sent me to. Memories that turn to dreams. Expanded but never changed. I can only succumb to the motions of my subconscious. Until I saw it. Nestled between a door that can’t be opened. A string. It’s real. I know it is.

Just beyond the glass. I can see it. The blinking. The frayed cords that keep my mind in pieces. The veil that shades. A helmed man sewing the walls with mirror-like thread.

I saw the man again today. As I graduated college in a field of shattered glass. Jace gave his valedictorian speech, muffled by a quilt of patchwork memory. Clara sat beside me, her hands fractured and split, but the rest of her more whole than before. Behind us all, at the edges of my mind, there he was. Helmed in a silver device that dripped wires and obscured his face. A man in black weaving strings.

After searching and searching, I’ve found the Weaver again.. He isn’t like the others. He is illusory, unspeaking and momentary. He sits in the far corners of the moment, weaving and weaving. If I blink, he is gone.

Transcription - 10:08am July 25th, 2318

As I continued to explore further into my depths, I watched for the Weaver’s next appearance. I began to dream again. Another life. One I’ve never lived. For moments, I’m so happy. In them I feel fulfilled but, when I realize what I’ve dreamt I’m consumed with guilt. I dream that Clara is mine. Today, I dreamt that we married young, full of passion and love. We had a wedding in the quarry we used to swim in as kids. If these entries are to be made public, please omit this one. I don’t know what Jace would think, I mean I was the best man at their wedding for god sake.

The only days that feel real are the ones where I’m alone. The mornings are shattered with glass and thread, but then the days are whole and real for a number of hours. I work, I eat lunch, I fill my days. Then, when the sun sets, the threads return and the shroud of mirrors falls once more.

Transcription - 9:02pm August 13th, 2318

Clara is all I can think of. So many moments are stuttered with her presence. Half here, half not. Sometimes Jace too, but never quite as fragmented. I tried to pull at the threads in the corners of my mind. It stings as though I had a thousand needles pressed into my temples. I had to stop otherwise I felt like I would shatter. It’s hard to focus on reliving. We were celebrating this week, I think. Jace got his fancy government tech job that he would never tell me about. He was so happy back then. We all were.

Transcription - 11:58am August 22th, 2318

I haven’t seen the Weaver recently, but then again I’ve been distracted. The day of the accident is growing closer, I’ve been trying to buy myself time to prepare but I need to use my time down here wisely since there isn’t much left. It’s why I came here after all. Something shifted in those days of black. It took something from me.

Transcription - 2:12pm September 7th, 2318

The accident is tomorrow. Which for me, will be in a few minutes, I think. I tried to stop myself from getting in the car, but that’s the one of the few things I could never interact with. I was in such a hurry, and for what? Nothing leading up to it had given it away. I had just looked so angry.

I’m glad it wasn't just darkness here too. I was in that bed for a long time, I guess I was still processing even if I couldn’t remember any of it on the surface. Clara’s stuttering ghost was here a lot. Jumping, fragmented. Jace would pop in too, I know his work kept him busy. At times they argued at the foot of my bed, their voices a muffled gibberish I couldn’t make out.

Transcription - 4:32am September 11th, 2318

The end of the dive is coming, I need more time!. These memories were more dreams than memories. This isn’t what I needed - this isn’t what was promised. These were supposed to be my memories! Real and dynamic and I could see what was wrong inside! I could fix it! What have you done!? Huh!? What happened to me?!

Transcription - 9:20pm September 12th, 2318

I’m beginning to - agh - to pull at the seams at the edges of my mind. The threads are cold and sharp. My head feels like it's shattering. Agh! But I can not go back…I can not...leave this place without answers.

The thread.. it’s…pulling away, the veil is pulling back. Haha! There are things beyond the shrouds, the mirrors are breaking! This is it! This is- What the..

The…the Weaver is here. Not an afterimage in the corner of my mind, but in this memory. In this room, at the foot of my bed. He’s wearing a device like the one you all gave me. It's more crude though, like a prototype. H-He’s connected to me. Clara is watching the hallway through the window in my hospital room door. She’s telling him to hurry. I’m trying to rip the device off his head, but it won’t come off! Work, come on! Expand and not interfere, my ass! Show me! 

He’s getting up! That’s right, show me who you are! Take it off you son of a…

I did it. I pulled at the threads, and the world around me shattered into a million pieces. The mirrors fell, the glass broke, and the Weaver...he was gone. I was left in a void, a dark, empty space. But then, something unexpected happened. The fragments began to reassemble, not into the world I knew, but into something entirely different.

I’m standing in a room. It’s sterile, white, and cold. There are machines everywhere, beeping and whirring. I see my body lying on a bed, hooked up to countless wires and tubes. My head is encased in a silver helmet, just like the Weaver’s. I realize with a jolt that I am the Weaver. I’ve been weaving my own memories, trying to piece together a life that was never mine.

I try to speak, but no words come out. The man continues, “You’ve been in a coma for five years. The Ruminate program was an experimental treatment to help you recover your memories. But it seems...it’s had some unintended side effects.”

I look down at my hands, realizing they are transparent, ghost-like. I’m not really here. I’m still in the program, still trapped in my own mind. The man in the lab coat looks at me with pity. “We’re going to try to bring you back,” he says. “But it’s going to take time.”

As he leaves the room, I feel a sense of despair wash over me. I thought I was exploring my past, but I was only weaving illusions. The real world is out of reach, and I am still lost in the labyrinth of my own mind. The Weaver was never an external force; it was me, trying to stitch together a reality that no longer exists.

1. The Weaver is actually a representation of the protagonist's subconscious mind trying to stitch together fragmented memories after a traumatic brain injury.
2. The protagonist is not in a virtual reality program but in a coma, and the ""dive"" is a metaphor for his journey through his own mind.
3. The accident was not just a car crash but a deliberate act by someone close to him, possibly Jace or Clara, which is why their memories are so fragmented and distorted.
4. The protagonist's feelings for Clara and the guilt he feels are central to the mystery; perhaps Clara was involved in the accident in a way that the protagonist's mind is trying to suppress.
5. The ""Ruminate pioneer program"" is actually a therapeutic technique to help coma patients regain consciousness by reliving their memories.

Combining these ideas, the ending could reveal that the protagonist is in a coma, the Weaver is his subconscious trying to piece together the truth, and the accident was a deliberate act by Clara, who felt trapped in her relationship with Jace and had feelings for the protagonist.

I found the Weaver again. He was waiting for me, as if he knew I would come. His silver helm glinted in the fractured light, and the threads he wove shimmered like liquid glass. I reached out, my fingers trembling, and grasped one of the threads. The pain was immediate and excruciating, but I didn’t let go. I pulled, and the world around me began to unravel.

Transcription - 12:05am September 13th, 2318

The Weaver didn’t stop me. He watched, his face obscured, as I pulled at the threads. The world shattered around me, each piece falling away into darkness. I felt myself breaking apart, my consciousness splintering into a thousand pieces. But I kept pulling, desperate to find the truth.

Transcription - 12:10am September 13th, 2318

As the last thread snapped, the Weaver stepped forward. He reached out and touched my forehead, and suddenly, everything became clear. The memories, the dreams, the fragments—they all coalesced into a single, horrifying truth.

Transcription - 12:15am September 13th, 2318

I wasn’t in the Ruminate program. I never was. The accident had left me in a coma, and everything I had experienced was a construct of my damaged mind. The Weaver was my subconscious, trying to piece together the shattered remnants of my identity. The threads were my memories, distorted and fragmented by the trauma.

Transcription - 12:20am September 13th, 2318

I realized then that I had been living in a dream, a purgatory of my own making. The Ruminate program, the dive, the exploration—it was all a way for my mind to cope with the reality of my condition. I had been searching for answers, but the truth was that there were none. I was broken, and no amount of reliving the past could change that.

Transcription - 12:25am September 13th, 2318

The Weaver began to weave again, but this time, the threads were different. They were whole, unbroken. He was giving me a choice: to stay in this dream, this illusion, or to wake up and face the reality of my broken body and shattered life.

They've noticed the Weaver, an enigmatic figure who seems to be responsible for the fragmented perceptions they are experiencing. The entries reflect a struggle against an internal and external force that is manipulating their consciousness, causing distorted memories, dreams, and a feeling of unreality.

The person's resolve to confront or break free from this manipulation grows as the entries progress, with the final entry being a real-time recording intended for discovery if they do not wake up again. The narrative ends on a cliffhanger, leaving readers to wonder whether the individual will succeed in their attempt to dismantle the weaver's strings and what consequences—if any—they might face upon awakening or ""shattering"" themselves.

The story leaves many questions unanswered: Who is the Weaver? What caused the person's distorted perception of reality? Is this a metaphorical journey through trauma, memory loss, or something more supernatural? The entries don't provide clear answers, instead offering a profound look into the psyche of someone battling against an unseen adversary and their own fractured sense of self.","z f p h"
"3",3,"Amateur Book Society",3,768,"1/6/2024","I was new to this whole book club thing. 

But I was fairly sure closed curtains and four Victorian-style chairs surrounding a wooden table with only potpourri-scented candles for light read more as “VSCO girl seance” than “Amateur Book Society” like their poster had advertised. 

It was just me, and three other girls who had obviously been doing this a lot longer than me: Lilith, Opal, and Leanne. They greeted me into the room like three separate heads on the same mom-jeans-ed, cardigan-ed mythical creature.

“Welcome in, have a seat,” Lilith said.

“We invite you to our society,” Opal said. 

“Hello new amateur book lover,” Leanne said. 

They told me that, as an initiation into their society, I had to read for them the first few pages of their collective favorite book. The title? An Ever Changing Love Story. 

Blegh, a romance. The book’s cover was the least promising part. It was a photo of a man with his shirt off, a candy cane caught between his perfect teeth. Was I surprised though? What else was I expecting from a book society that admitted to their amateur title? I preferred a good gory mystery thriller over anything overtly romantic. When I said as much to the club’s members, they all were clear that I would not dislike the book.

“We insist, you must try it,” Lilith said. 

“I’ve read it ten times,” Opal said. 

“Oh, you’ll just fall right in,” Leanne said, to which the other two club members giggled. 

Oh, well. What harm would it do to just read the first page? It was a book.

I opened to the first page. Was this the year that the small town Christmas tree farm suffered without her, she wondered, if she was busy with her even planning job in the big city?

I felt a breeze blow in my face and looked up momentarily. I wasn’t in the Amateur Book Society’s seance anymore. The book (and really everything) had vanished, replaced with a generic-looking big city apartment, with high beige ceilings and a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking a concrete jungle below. I was now seated at a white dining room table decorated with generic T.J.Maxx Christmas memorabilia. I had an empty plate in front of me, and a mug that read “Joy”  in Rae Dunn font. I wasn’t the only one at the table, either. 

The young man, whose face I recognized from the cover of the book, sat across from me at the table. He was in fact wearing a shirt this time. A checkered flannel rolled up to his elbows. At the head of the table sat a beautiful woman with long black hair and a siren stare. Unfortunately, it wasn’t aimed at me. She wore a long red dress with a dipping v-neck and matching ruby-red earrings. It was obvious who had put more effort into looking good today. 

“Thanks again for inviting us, Darcy,” the man said, addressing the host at the head of the table. 

“It was my pleasure, Ethan,” Darcy said, a grin spreading across her red lips. “How about a toast?”

Darcy swiped her black hair to the front of her neck, as if posing for a photo, and then raised a glass of red wine. I noticed the man, Ethan, also had a wine glass. My wine…was in a Rae Dunn mug. 

“Here’s to new friends, who may be with us a while, or for just a short time,” Darcy said. She leaned forward to clink Ethan’s glass, completely exposing anything else that was hidden under the dress’s neckline. I noticed that she decisively ignored my offered cup to toast as well. Her eyes remained trained on Ethan. 

“Drink up,” she said, and Ethan took her words to heart. He engulfed the contents of his glass in one gulp.

“Sorry again I only had two wine glasses,” Darcy said to me. The way she said it made me think she wasn’t sorry at all. Who was this chick? As a matter of fact, what was I doing here in the first place? 

Didn’t a toast usually occur during a meal? Where was the food?

Ethan reached across the table and took my hand in his. I held the urge to barf. What was he going to do next, pour his heart out?

“I know this must be hard for you,” he said sincerely, “but the Christmas tree farm will be fine without you this year. I want you to know that we understand you must feel so guilty since you’ve always done the event planning for the farm’s annual Nutcracker Festival. And with my mom’s recent passing, we weren’t sure if anyone would be able to pull that weight. But really, we’re all so happy that you’re here pursuing your passion in the big city.”

Dang, I wasn’t feeling guilty before but I sure was now. 

“Big city…Do you know where we are exactly?” I asked.

Darcy and Ethan stared at me blankly. And then Darcy began coughing. No, choking. How had she choked? There was literally no food at the table?

Suddenly, she was on the floor holding her throat and gasping for air. Ethan and I rushed to her side. Darcy began foaming at the mouth, and her gasps for breath got weaker and further in between until finally she went completely limp. 

I was no doctor, but this girl looked extremely dead. 

“Call 911,” I called to Ethan. He stumbled pulling a phone from his pocket, and then left the room. I’m glad he would be able to call an ambulance. I would have had no idea where we were if they had asked. But then, I heard sirens almost immediately outside already. 

Literally thirty seconds after Ethan had left the room, paramedics burst into the apartment. They swiftly belted Darcy to a stretcher and left in a hurry. Did she need company maybe? Shouldn’t we be going with her?

I looked to Ethan for direction, but he just stood staring at the doorway. Almost as if given an invisible cue, he turned to me and took both of my hands in his. He was much shorter than I had imagined. 

“Look, I know this is all happening so fast. But I want you to know I’ll always be here for you. Always have been, always will be. Would you like to discuss coming to visit me in the small town where we both grew up?”

Wait, what?

“Ethan--no. We can’t just ignore the fact that a woman just died in this apartment. We need to find out what happened.”

Ethan stared at me for a moment and then said, “But that’s not significant to the plot.”

“The what?”

He didn’t elaborate. 

“Maybe we should clean up a bit?” he asked.

Why not? In my confusion, I felt the urge myself to tidy things around the apartment. Darcy’s glass of wine had fallen over, leaving a red stain all over her tablecloth and carpet. 

I headed toward the kitchen cabinets to search for chemicals that might remove the stains. Ethan went to take the place settings from the table, reaching for my Rae Dunn mug of wine first. And then he immediately spilled it all over his flannel. 

“Oh no,” he said. But he didn’t seem that startled. And for some reason, he took this opportunity to remove his shirt. All he had on top was the flannel. He was now completely shirtless. 

Ethan had storybook abs, just like the picture on the cover of the Amateur Book Society’s copy of An Ever Changing Love Story. This isn’t real, I thought to myself. But that didn’t keep me from staring. 

I realized no one had addressed me by my name yet. I knew Ethan, I knew Darcy, but who was I in this storyline?

“What’s my name?” I asked Ethan, making sure to look at his eyes and not somewhere else.

“Hm, that’s a good question. What do you think your name is?” he said. 

That wasn’t an answer. In fact, that was an extremely sketchy way to address someone he had obviously known most of his life. 

“I think--I know it’s Elizabeth,” I said.

What had happened before I arrived in the book? Had all these characters just appeared when I opened An Ever Changing Love Story, or had they been living their lives this whole time without me here? Was any of that significant to the plot? I asked Ethan to tell me everything he remembered from this interaction with Darcy. 

Ethan looked much less surprised at this question than I had expected. He was still shirtless, but he seemed just as much at ease, taking a stroll over to the living room couch and taking a seat before saying anything. 

“Well, we showed up together to Darcy’s apartment. I’ve only been visiting you from our hometown for two days, but Darcy insisted that you come over for a meal, and so I came along, too. She didn’t offer us any food, she said ‘There will be plenty of time for that later,’ and then poured us all wine. And then…she choked.”

“Alright, well that doesn’t really tell me anything. She wasn’t very nice, though, was she?” I said.

Ethan shrugged. “I don’t know, she was a good enough host,” he said. His nonchalance shocked me. I thought back to how cold Darcy had acted toward me, and how inviting she had acted toward Ethan in comparison. Had Darcy invited us because she liked Ethan? 

I shook my head and laughed to myself. I was here for, like, two minutes and I was already trying to turn this romance novel into a mystery. 

I headed into the kitchen to search for things that would help me clean. Now there were two stains on the carpet--one from Darcy’s cup and one from mine after Ethan’s spill. And dude was lounging on the couch, being of no help at all. 

I started digging through Darcy’s cabinets. She was incredibly well-organized, and her assortment of glassware and plates were even sorted by color. There was a rainbow assortment of dishware, but nothing that would help rid her floor of wine. Next, I tried under the sink. Sure enough, next to dish sponges and pipe brushes was Shout stain remover and Arm and Hammer carpet cleaner. And rat poison. 

Rat poison served as a convenient way to kill off characters in mystery novels. But really, who was I to bring murder into a basic love story?

I laughed at myself again, but this time in self criticism. I had literally judged a book by its cover. No one had told me there would be any lack of mystery in this story, I had just assumed that the shirtless man on the cover told me all I needed to know about this place. 

Had Darcy planned to off me with rat poison? But then why had she been the one to foam at the mouth?

This called for a good old fashioned “confront the enemy” scene. 

“Why are we here at the hospital  again?” Ethan asked. 

I said nothing. I wasn’t ready to explain again why we had needed to come see Darcy. He would never understand. From my understanding, he was just a man written for a romance plot. 

After leaving the apartment, the book had transported us right to the entrance of Darcy’s hospital room. I loved fiction. 

Turns out, Darcy didn’t die. After being brought to the hospital, she only fell into a coma. I didn’t know how her being alive was still good for a romance plot? Maybe the lack of PG-13 themes of death.

I knocked on Darcy’s door. Obviously, there was no answer. She was unconscious on a hospital bed. 

I sat in the chair next to her and grabbed her hand. In a good detective story, there was always some sort of villain monologue. If I could just figure out a way to get her to talk…

“Is it really you?”

I looked to Darcy, who had opened her eyes. I couldn’t believe my luck. But, then again, I still needed to get a confession out of the would-be murderer…

","

“My love,” Darcy said. 

Love?

“Yes, my love,” Darcy said again, “you thought I would have forgotten about our relationship so easily? It would take more than poison to take me away from you.”

Darcy took a long breath to continue, and I didn’t want to cut her off. This was even juicier than I had expected. 

“I’ve always loved you,” Darcy said. “And it’s a shame your hometown farm boy had to come and step in the way of us.” A tear escaped down her pale cheek. “I had no intention of poisoning anyone, but when he showed up with you to my home, I couldn’t take it anymore. I set a glass of tainted wine in front of Ethan, but somehow I ended up with it. I’m so sorry.” 

The gears began to turn in my head. “So all of that coldness you showed toward me…”

“It was just a show,” Darcy said. “If he thought he was safe, if he thought he was the object of my desire, he was less likely to ask questions and then, with him out of the picture, it would be just the two of us. Don’t you remember all the fun we had after event planning meetings at the big city office?”

I paused for a moment. Up until this point, Darcy’s language had been almost too elevated to be part of this cheesy story. But with her mention of “the big city,” I remembered where I was. Would really no one have figured out Darcy’s situation if I hadn’t paused the main storyline to investigate? 

“Darcy,” I began, piecing together this convoluted tale. “Do you actually know where we are?”

“They’ve never told us,” Darcy said. They? “The story writers--we’re just supposed to follow a script, but this is the first time ever you’ve visited me after I am carried away from the apartment. I don’t have lines for this. It’s refreshing.” Her voice took a darker tone, and I realized she was no longer talking just about me. “It’s so sad that the girl swoons for Ethan every time. Especially when they see him shirtless.”

My heart stopped in my chest. This was all just a play. I had stepped into a book, messed with some of the more critical plot points, but somehow ended up being the victim of the storytellers’ romantic imagination.

I excused myself from the room and turned the corner to see Ethan slouched on a hospital bench. He really hadn’t gotten a shirt when we got here? 

“Hey,” I said to Ethan. He looked up at me and smiled as if we weren’t standing outside the room of his victim. 

“Tell me what happens with the wine,” I demanded. 

“The what?”

“The wine, dumbass. Tell me what you were told to do with the wine.”

“Oh, well, I’m supposed to spill a glass on my shirt so that it’s so ruined I have to take it off.”

“What else?”

“Ummm…Oh right, I’m also supposed to switch mine and Darcy’s wine glasses while she’s looking away. I’ve never understood that part of my script, but I guess I’m not really the guy in charge, am I,” he said, adding a genuine careless laugh at the end. 

And even with all that, I believed him. Poor dumb Ethan. He was literally just here to please the female lead. 

Solving this mystery made me realize that there were several more unsolved cases that probably needed addressing in this world. I needed to come back. I needed to save these poor characters, who the writers deemed “insignificant,” and give them a chance of their own. 

But for now, I had done it. 

“We’re done,” I said to Ethan. 

The same breeze that had brought me here began to pick up again. I could smell the familiar scent of potpourri candles in the book club’s meeting room. I didn’t want to leave yet. There were so many other unresolved points of this story. 

“Aw man, I didn’t even get my kiss” I heard Ethan say as I was whisked away.

I was back in the room of the Amateur Book Society. I didn’t realize I was breathing hard until I accidentally blew out one of the candles in front of me.

“So, how’d you like it?” Lilith asked.

“We’re eager to know,” Opal said.

“Would you recommend?” Leanne asked.

I paused, almost too eager to join into their chorus. 

“Can I borrow this book until our next meeting?” I asked. 

The three other members of the Amateur Book Society grinned and said in unison, “There’s a sequel.”","Darcy's eyes fluttered open, and she looked at me with a mixture of confusion and recognition. I squeezed her hand, trying to appear as empathetic as possible.

""Yes, Darcy, it's me,"" I said softly. ""I need to know what happened back at your apartment. Why did you choke? Was it something in the wine?""

Darcy's eyes widened, and she tried to sit up, but the effort seemed too much for her weakened state. She settled back into the pillows, her breathing shallow but steady.

""It wasn't the wine,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""It was... the book.""

""The book?"" I echoed, my mind racing. ""What do you mean?""

Darcy's gaze shifted to Ethan, who was standing awkwardly by the door, his shirt still conspicuously absent. ""Ethan... he doesn't know. None of them do.""

""None of who?"" I pressed, leaning closer.

""The characters,"" Darcy said, her voice gaining a bit of strength. ""They're all trapped in the book. Every time someone new reads it, they get pulled into the story, and the characters... they change. They adapt to the new reader's preferences.""

I felt a chill run down my spine. ""So, you're saying that Ethan and everyone else in the book are... real people? Trapped?""

Darcy nodded weakly. ""Yes. And the book... it feeds off the readers. It needs new people to keep the story going. That's why the book club exists. To find new readers.""

I stood up, my mind reeling. ""But why did you choke? How did that happen?""

Darcy's eyes filled with tears. ""I tried to warn you. I tried to break free from the story's control. But the book... it punished me.""

I turned to Ethan, who was now looking at me with a mixture of confusion and fear. ""Ethan, do you remember anything before the book?""

He shook his head slowly. ""No. I only remember the story. The small town, the Christmas tree farm... it's all I've ever known.""

I realized then that I had to get out of this twisted narrative. I had to find a way to escape the book's grasp and free the others trapped within its pages.

""Darcy, how do I get out?"" I asked urgently.

She closed her eyes, her strength fading. ""You have to finish the story. But be careful... the book will try to keep you here. It will change the plot to trap you.""

I nodded, determination filling me. I turned to Ethan. ""We need to finish this story. We need to find a way to end it.""

Ethan looked at me, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. ""I'll help you. Whatever it takes.""

As we left the hospital room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. The book had already shown its power, and I knew it wouldn't let us go easily. But I was determined to find a way out, to free myself and the others from its clutches.

And as we stepped back into the apartment, the book's cover lying innocently on the table, I knew that the real mystery was just beginning.","<brainstorm>
1. **Darcy's True Intentions**: Darcy was actually trying to protect Elizabeth from something sinister in the book world. The rat poison was meant for Ethan, who is not who he seems.
2. **Ethan's Dark Secret**: Ethan is actually a villain in disguise, and Darcy was trying to warn Elizabeth. The choking was a result of Ethan's attempt to silence Darcy.
3. **Elizabeth's Real Identity**: Elizabeth is actually a character from another book who was transported into this romance novel. Darcy recognized her and tried to help her escape.
4. **The Book Club's Hidden Agenda**: The book club is actually a group of sorceresses who use books to trap people in alternate realities. Elizabeth was their latest target, but Darcy was an undercover agent trying to save her.
5. **The Book's Curse**: The book ""An Ever Changing Love Story"" is cursed, and anyone who reads it gets trapped in its world. Darcy was a previous victim trying to break the curse by getting Elizabeth to help her.

""Is it really you?"" Darcy's voice was weak but filled with a strange mix of relief and urgency.

""Yes, it's me,"" I replied, squeezing her hand. ""But I need to know what happened. Why did you choke? Was it the wine?""

Darcy's eyes darted to Ethan, who was standing by the door, looking confused and concerned. ""It wasn't the wine,"" she whispered. ""It was him.""

Ethan's face twisted in confusion. ""What are you talking about, Darcy?""

Darcy struggled to sit up, her eyes never leaving Ethan. ""He's not who he says he is. He's a character from another book, a villain. The book club... they use these books to trap people in alternate realities. I was trying to protect you, Elizabeth.""

I felt a chill run down my spine. ""But why me? Why would they target me?""

""Because you're special,"" Darcy said, her voice gaining strength. ""You're not just any reader. You have the ability to change the story, to break the curse. They wanted to trap you here forever, but I couldn't let that happen.""

Ethan's expression darkened, and he took a step forward. ""Darcy, you're delirious. You don't know what you're saying.""

But I could see the truth in Darcy's eyes. ""Stay back, Ethan,"" I said, my voice firm. ""I believe her.""

Ethan's facade cracked, and his eyes glinted with malice. ""You should have just played along, Elizabeth. Now, you'll never leave this book.""

Before he could make a move, I grabbed the Rae Dunn mug and hurled it at him. It shattered against his head, and he stumbled back, dazed.

""Darcy, how do we get out of here?"" I asked urgently.

""Read the last page,"" she gasped. ""It's the only way to break the spell.""

I fumbled for the book, flipping to the final page. As I read the last words aloud, the world around us began to blur and shift. The hospital room dissolved, and I found myself back in the dimly lit room of the Amateur Book Society.

Lilith, Opal, and Leanne were staring at me, their expressions a mix of shock and anger. ""You broke the spell,"" Lilith hissed.

I stood up, feeling a newfound strength. ""And I'll make sure no one else falls into your trap.""

With that, I turned and walked out of the room, leaving the book club and their sinister plans behind. I had escaped the story, but I knew I had to warn others. The Amateur Book Society was far more dangerous than anyone could have imagined.

","""Darcy, you're awake!"" I exclaimed, trying to mask my surprise with relief. Ethan stood awkwardly by the door, his shirt still missing, looking more like a lost puppy than a romantic hero.

Darcy's eyes fluttered open, and she looked around the room, disoriented. ""What happened?"" she croaked, her voice weak.

""You choked at the dinner table,"" I said, squeezing her hand gently. ""But you're okay now. The paramedics got you here in time.""

She blinked, her eyes focusing on me. ""Elizabeth, right?"" she asked, her voice gaining strength. ""I remember you... and Ethan.""

""Yes, that's right,"" I said, glancing at Ethan, who was now fidgeting with a hospital pamphlet. ""Darcy, do you remember anything about what happened before you choked?""

Darcy's brow furrowed as she tried to recall the events. ""I... I remember pouring the wine,"" she said slowly. ""And then... nothing. Just darkness.""

I took a deep breath, deciding to take a gamble. ""Darcy, I found rat poison in your kitchen. Do you know anything about that?""

Her eyes widened in shock. ""Rat poison? No, I don't have any rats. Why would I have that?""

I studied her face, looking for any sign of deceit, but she seemed genuinely confused. ""It was under your sink, next to the cleaning supplies,"" I said. ""Do you think someone could have put it there?""

Darcy's eyes darted to Ethan, who was now looking at us with a puzzled expression. ""Ethan, did you see anyone else in the apartment?"" she asked.

Ethan shook his head. ""No, it was just the three of us. Why would anyone want to poison you, Darcy?""

Darcy's face paled as she seemed to realize something. ""Wait... the wine. I didn't drink any of it. I poured it for you two, but I didn't have any myself.""

I felt a chill run down my spine. ""So, the poison was meant for us?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Darcy nodded slowly. ""It must have been. But who would do such a thing?""

Suddenly, the door to the hospital room burst open, and Lilith, Opal, and Leanne stormed in, their faces twisted with anger. ""You weren't supposed to survive,"" Lilith hissed, her eyes blazing with fury.

Opal and Leanne flanked her, their expressions equally menacing. ""We needed you out of the way, Elizabeth,"" Opal said coldly. ""You were never meant to be part of our story.""

I stood up, my heart pounding in my chest. ""What are you talking about?"" I demanded. ""Why would you want to kill me?""

Leanne sneered. ""Because you don't belong here. This is our story, our world. You were just a pawn, a means to an end.""

Ethan stepped forward, his face a mask of confusion. ""What is going on? Who are you people?""

Lilith laughed, a chilling sound that sent shivers down my spine. ""We're the authors, Ethan. We control the narrative. And Elizabeth was never supposed to be part of it.""

I felt a surge of anger and defiance. ""You can't just kill people to fit your story,"" I said, my voice trembling with rage. ""This isn't a book. These are real lives.""

Lilith's eyes narrowed. ""Oh, but it is a book, Elizabeth. And we are the ones writing it.""

With that, the room began to spin, and I felt myself being pulled back, away from the hospital, away from Darcy and Ethan, and back into the dimly lit room with the Victorian chairs and potpourri-scented candles.

I gasped for breath, my heart racing as I looked around. Lilith, Opal, and Leanne were standing in front of me, their expressions smug and satisfied.

""Welcome back,"" Lilith said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Did you enjoy your little adventure?""

I glared at them, my mind racing with questions. ""What was the point of all this?"" I demanded. ""Why go through all that trouble?""

Opal shrugged. ""We needed a new protagonist for our story. Someone who could bring a fresh perspective. But you... you were too unpredictable.""

Leanne smirked. ""So we decided to write you out. Permanently.""

I felt a surge of defiance. ""You can't control me,"" I said, my voice steady. ""I won't let you.""

Lilith's smile widened. ""Oh, but we already have, Elizabeth. And now, it's time for you to leave.""

With a wave of her hand, the room began to fade, and I felt myself being pulled away, back to my own world, my own reality.

As I opened my eyes, I found myself back in my apartment, the book club's poster crumpled in my hand. I took a deep breath, my heart still racing from the ordeal.

I knew one thing for sure: I would never underestimate the power of a book again. And I would never, ever, join another book club.","
As I sat there with Darcy's unconscious form lying still on the hospital bed, she slowly blinked her eyes open again, offering me a glimmer of hope. My heart raced as I grasped her hand tightly, praying for a sign that this was reality and not just another chapter from An Ever Changing Love Story.

""Is it really you?"" I whispered in disbelief. Darcy gave no verbal response but weakly squeezed my hand - a positive affirmation! But the situation still needed clarity; there had to be an explanation, and as per detective story conventions, perhaps even a confession from a would-be murderer...

""Can you hear me?"" I asked gently. ""It's okay, Darcy, we need to talk.""

Darcy looked at me with glazed eyes, still weak but awake. The spark of recognition flickered in her gaze and a sigh of relief washed over me - she hadn’t died after all. 

""It's really you?"" I asked again, hoping to break the ice as we often see in those good detective stories when a character regains consciousness only to reveal crucial information or confess their misdeeds. But there was silence from Darcy. My excitement simmered down, and I realized that maybe things aren't always as they seem - even in romance plots.

I sat silently for a while just holding her hand, contemplating the situation at hand. It wasn’t like this was a scene right out of an Agatha Christie novel where the villain would suddenly break down and confess. 

""Do you know what happened here, Darcy? I need to understand,"" I finally broke the silence after a while, hoping that she might divulge something useful. But it wasn't just about solving this mystery anymore, I realized. This was real life - unpredictable and devoid of plot devices, and Darcy had been so kind in her own way until today when she had acted out-of-character with me but warmer towards Ethan. Was that a part of the book's narrative or just a character trait?

I started rummaging through Darcy’s cabinets once again, this time looking for something to help clean up not only her floor but also my misunderstandings about what was happening here. As I suspected earlier, she was incredibly well-organized and even had an array of glassware and plates sorted by color - a testament to the author's attention to detail.

I found myself inexplicably drawn into this book – An Ever Changing Love Story – but not for its romance plot anymore, now that there was no apparent danger. Instead, I was here to unravel the mystery and find answers. 

""Why did you invite us over today, Darcy?"" Ethan suddenly asked as he walked into the room, breaking my train of thought. He looked confused, but I couldn’t blame him; he was just a character created for a love plot, after all. His nonchalance had me shocked - especially when compared to Darcy's initial coldness towards me and her warmth towards Ethan.

I chose to say nothing about our real purpose of being here as I didn’t want to have to explain again why we had needed to come see her in the hospital. He would never understand, after all, he was just a man written for a romance plot.","p f h z"

Spring of 2047 (35 A.E.)

Near Denver, Free Republic of Colorado

Thomas Newbury peered through the pre-Event telescope, his gaze fixed on the celestial canvas above. His routine pursuit involved scouring the heavens for a new comet, not merely for the thrill of discovery but as a means to eke out a meager living in this post-apocalyptic world. The solar flare storm that ravaged Earth's communications and electricity on December 21st, 2012, had plunged humanity into a stark and unforgiving reality. Yet, in the midst of desolation, Thomas found solace in the cosmic mysteries that unfolded above, hoping that the celestial bodies would guide him to both discovery and survival.

As Thomas hummed to the cosmic rhythm, Cecelia T. remained alone by the crackling campfire, seeking warmth in the midst of the desolate landscape. The aroma of brewing coffee wafted through the air, a comforting ritual in their harsh existence. In this post-apocalyptic world, where the remnants of civilization clung to survival, coffee was a precious commodity sourced from distant lands, primarily California and other southern farmers.

The trade routes into Colorado had become treacherous, haunted by the specters of an abandoned past. Many roads, once bustling with life, were now reclaimed by the encroaching wilderness. The journey for traders was an intense and perilous one, often leading them to forsake these routes altogether. Only on rare occasions did a determined trader venture through, opening a fleeting window for commerce and exchange in the desolate terrain. Cecelia, her hands absorbing the warmth from the campfire, contemplated the fragile threads that bound their isolated existence to the outside world.

""Some day... you'll know... I was the one..."" Cecelia T. sang softly to herself, the melodic notes weaving through the crackling of the fire, reminiscent of a vintage vinyl record playing its haunting tune. The flames danced in tandem with her melancholic melody.

""There's nothing going on in the cosmos tonight,"" Thomas observed, his attention shifting to the moon. ""Nothing on Luna either,"" he added, scanning the lunar landscape for any signs of celestial activity.

Cecelia, her dark skin illuminated by the fire's glow, gazed into the flickering flames as if seeking answers within. Her braided hair framed her face, and in her brown eyes, a hint of longing and introspection lingered. ""You'll find something soon. When was the last discovery?"" she inquired, her voice a gentle reassurance amidst the vast emptiness that surrounded them. The firelight cast shadows on her face, reflecting the uncertainty that echoed within.

A distant hoot echoed through the vast high plains, causing Thomas to pause and survey the expanse around them. The ancient trees, scattered like sentinels, adorned the slopes of the mountain named Blue Sky. It was here, in the embrace of nature, that the two friends had chosen to spend most of their days. The cities, once bustling centers of civilization, now carried the scars of devastation wrought by radiation from the plant explosions following the Event.

Though none of the plants were situated in the state of Colorado, the relentless winds and rain had carried the radiation far and wide, leaving a trail of destruction. Some cities lay in ruins, rendered uninhabitable by the aftermath of the catastrophic events. Yet, the mountains, like a natural shield, had impeded the spread of the radiation, bestowing Denver with a comparative sanctuary.

As Thomas continued to scan the horizon, the coyote's call lingered in the air, a reminder of the untamed world that persisted beyond the flickering flames of their campfire. In the face of the remnants of the old world and the challenges of the new, the mountain named Blue Sky stood as a silent witness to their resilient existence.

""Ah, a shooting star! Look at it shine through the sky!"" Thomas exclaimed, his excitement evident in the gleam of his eyes.

Cecelia, however, remained nonchalant, flicking dry skin from her fingers. ""Not worth a penny. Shooting stars in the sky... makes a grown man cry..."" she commented, her tone carrying a hint of detachment.

""But aren't they beautiful? Priceless,"" Thomas responded, his happiness undiminished by Cecelia's pragmatism.

""Not by choice,"" she retorted, a subtle weight in her words.

""Okay, okay,"" Thomas conceded, returning his gaze to the celestial canvas above. The stars adorned the night sky, each one a distant beacon in the vastness of the post-apocalyptic world. Despite the desolation that surrounded them, the brilliance of the stars painted a scene of enduring beauty, a stark contrast to the harsh realities of their existence.

""We're running out of good food. Y'know, the fresher stuff? We're down to canned beans, some are old, no doubt botulism has taken over,"" Cecelia remarked, her voice carrying the weight of practical concerns. She rose from her seat, stretched, and made her way over to the RV. The vehicle, a pre-Event relic, once pristine and shiny in pearl, now bore the scars of time, its exterior yellowed and aged.

Thomas, meticulous in his ways, had maintained the inside of the RV with unwavering care. The interior remained a sanctuary of order and organization, a stark contrast to the unpredictable and often harsh world outside. As Cecelia ventured inside, the RV served as both a refuge and a reminder of a past that seemed distant and unattainable. The challenge of survival had reshaped not just the landscape but also the very essence of what once constituted normalcy.

As the night unfolded, Cecelia opted to stay within the confines of their makeshift home, seeking solace in the embrace of sleep. Her decision to rest, a luxury in their unpredictable existence, echoed through the quiet confines of the RV.

Thomas, engrossed in the celestial spectacle outside, remained happily awake, oblivious to the absence of his friend. It wasn't until he decided to indulge in a cup of coffee that he realized Cecelia's retreat into slumber. The silence within the RV spoke volumes, and as Thomas prepared his coffee, the solitude weighed on him.

Undeterred by the solitude, he chose to forego sleep, the bitter aroma of the coffee filling the air as he consumed cup after cup. In the glow of the campfire's fading embers and the distant stars, Thomas found solace in the rhythm of the night, a sentinel in the vast expanse of their landscape.

The morning sun cast its golden hues over the plains landscape as Thomas skillfully crafted an omelette over the crackling fire. The iron pan, a relic of recycled iron products from the remnants of the old world, sizzled with butter as the eggs cooked, sending bits of hot splatter in every direction. The aroma of cooking breakfast wafted through the air, a welcome contrast to the challenges of their daily existence.

As the omelette neared completion, Thomas turned his attention to a pot where canned potatoes were boiling, soon to be mashed. The combination might not have been a typical breakfast fare, but in this world where sustenance was a precious commodity, any edible provisions were cherished.

""We're almost out of potatoes!"" Thomas called out, the urgency in his voice cutting through the morning tranquility. ""Well, the canned ones, that is.""

Cecelia, still enveloped in the embrace of sleep on her bare mattress within the RV, remained unaware of the impending shortage. Nearby, a teddy bear crafted by her older brother sat on its rear, its black buttons serving as vacant eyes that stared into the uncertain expanse beyond.

As the natural rhythm of the wild played out around them, with coyotes on the hunt and mule deer grazing in the distance, Thomas enjoyed his omelette, humming contentedly. Each mouthful of egg, seasoned with precious salt and pepper, was a small luxury in their harsh world. The simple act of enjoying a well-cooked meal provided a brief respite from the constant struggle for survival.

Satisfied and full yet weighed down by the cumulative effect of a sleepless night, Thomas swiftly wrapped up his morning routine. He made his way to the RV, seeking the comfort of his own makeshift bed. Though the mattress was of cheap material, an array of pillows offered a semblance of comfort and luxury, a small but significant haven in a world that had been stripped down to the bare essentials. The RV, with its memories and the safety it offered, was more than just a vehicle; it was a home and a sanctuary in the midst of a world forever changed.

In the tranquil embrace of the morning, Thomas and Cecelia found solace in sleep, their snores a testament to their exhaustion and the comfort they felt within the confines of their beloved RV. This humble abode, a symbol of their perseverance and resilience, had become more than just shelter; it was a repository of memories and a bastion of safety in a world that had been irrevocably altered.

","

Unknown to the sleeping friends, their peaceful interlude was about to be disrupted. Stealthily, a pack of trained wolves, each bearing the scars of survival and adorned with harnesses, infiltrated the campsite. They moved with a purpose, guided by a man wearing a straw hat, his presence exuding authority and intent. Flanking him were his goons, each one equipped with post-Event swords and pistols - a formidable arsenal in this new world order.

This armed entourage presented a stark contrast to the modest defenses of Thomas and Cecelia. The two friends, scientists by profession and now survivors by necessity, shared a single revolver between them. It was a worn-out weapon, a symbol of their non-violent past, which had yet to be tested in the face of danger.

In the unfolding narrative of their lives, Thomas and Cecelia, like all who dwell in this post-Event world, are constantly reminded of the fragile balance between life and death. The arrival of the armed strangers, led by the man in the straw hat, casts a foreboding shadow over the campsite, a stark reminder of the ever-present threat that lurks in their new reality.

Death, an inescapable truth of existence, looms large in this harsh and unforgiving era. It stands in stark contrast to the brief period in human history where life was comparatively easy, a time that now seems like a distant dream. Thomas and Cecelia, born just on the cusp of this drastic change, missed the chance to experience that era of relative ease and prosperity.

As they sleep, unaware of the danger that has stealthily encroached upon their sanctuary, their fate hangs in a delicate balance. The peaceful morning, once a respite from their daily struggles, now teeters on the brink of becoming a grim reminder of the ruthless nature of their world.

In this post-2012 landscape, every new dawn is a gift, and every encounter with others is a roll of the dice, where fortunes can change in an instant, and the line between life and death is perilously thin. The story of Thomas and Cecelia, like that of many others in their time, is a testament to the endurance of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity.

Life, inevitably, meets its conclusion. Some succumb to the cruel embrace of bullet wounds, while others yield to the relentless jaws of a savage canine.

Thomas Newbury b. 2020 (8 A.E.) d. 2047 (35 A.E.) age 27

Cecelia Teth b. 2021 (9 A.E.) d. 2047 (35 A.E.) age 26","As the sun climbed higher, casting long shadows across the plains, a distant rumble broke the morning's stillness. Thomas stirred, his eyes fluttering open. He glanced at the clock on the RV's dashboard—10:00 AM. The rumble grew louder, more insistent, and Thomas's heart quickened. He scrambled out of bed, his mind racing with possibilities. Was it a trader? A rare visitor? Or something more sinister?

He rushed outside, the bright sunlight momentarily blinding him. As his vision adjusted, he saw a convoy of vehicles approaching, their engines roaring like a pack of wild beasts. Dust clouds billowed behind them, and Thomas's stomach churned with a mix of hope and dread.

""Cecelia! Wake up!"" he shouted, his voice tinged with urgency. ""We've got company!""

Cecelia emerged from the RV, her eyes bleary with sleep. She squinted at the approaching convoy, her expression unreadable. ""Who do you think they are?"" she asked, her voice steady despite the tension in the air.

""I don't know,"" Thomas replied, his eyes never leaving the convoy. ""But we need to be ready for anything.""

The vehicles came to a halt a few yards away, and a group of armed men and women disembarked. Their leader, a tall man with a scar running down his cheek, stepped forward. He surveyed Thomas and Cecelia with a cold, calculating gaze.

""Good morning,"" the leader said, his voice smooth but menacing. ""We're here for a little... trade.""

Thomas swallowed hard, his mind racing. ""What do you want?"" he asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

The leader's eyes flicked to the RV, then back to Thomas. ""We heard you have something valuable. Something that could change everything.""

Thomas's heart pounded in his chest. ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The leader smirked. ""Oh, I think you do. You see, we've been tracking you for a while. We know about your little hobby—scanning the skies, looking for something special.""

Thomas's blood ran cold. How could they know? He glanced at Cecelia, who stood frozen, her eyes wide with fear.

The leader took a step closer, his smirk widening. ""We know about the comet, Thomas. The one you discovered last night. The one that's on a collision course with Earth.""

Thomas's breath caught in his throat. ""How... how do you know?""

The leader's smirk turned into a grin. ""Let's just say we have our sources. Now, hand over the coordinates, and we might just let you live.""

Thomas's mind raced. The comet—his discovery—was supposed to be their salvation, a beacon of hope in a world gone dark. But now, it was a weapon in the hands of these strangers.

He glanced at Cecelia, who gave him a barely perceptible nod. They had no choice.

Thomas took a deep breath and stepped forward, his hand trembling as he reached into his pocket. He pulled out a small, weathered notebook and handed it to the leader.

The leader's grin widened as he flipped through the pages. ""Good boy,"" he said, tucking the notebook into his jacket. ""Now, if you'll excuse us, we have a world to save—or destroy, depending on our mood.""

As the convoy roared to life and sped away, Thomas and Cecelia stood in stunned silence. The weight of their discovery—and the consequences of their actions—settled heavily on their shoulders.

In the vast expanse of the post-apocalyptic world, the stars above seemed to mock them, their distant light a reminder of the fragile threads that bound their existence to the cosmos. And as the dust settled, Thomas and Cecelia knew that their lives—and the fate of humanity—had been irrevocably altered.","<brainstorm>

1. **Hidden Agenda**: Cecelia is not just a companion but has a hidden agenda. She might be a spy or have a secret mission that involves Thomas.
2. **Celestial Discovery**: Thomas discovers something in the sky that changes everything, perhaps a signal or a sign of extraterrestrial life.
3. **Past Connection**: Thomas and Cecelia have a deeper connection from before the Event that neither of them remembers until a triggering event.
4. **Betrayal**: Cecelia betrays Thomas for a greater cause or personal gain, revealing her true intentions.
5. **Survival Revelation**: The RV or their location has a hidden feature or secret that ensures their survival or reveals a new path forward.

**Best Idea**: Combine elements of Hidden Agenda and Past Connection. Cecelia has a hidden agenda related to a past connection with Thomas that neither of them fully remembers until a triggering event.

As the morning sun continued to rise, casting long shadows over the plains, a sudden, sharp noise jolted Thomas awake. He sat up, heart pounding, and glanced around the RV. Cecelia was already up, her eyes wide with alarm.

""Did you hear that?"" she whispered, her voice trembling.

Thomas nodded, grabbing a makeshift weapon—a sturdy metal rod—before cautiously stepping outside. Cecelia followed, her eyes scanning the horizon. The source of the noise became apparent as they saw a figure approaching, stumbling and disoriented.

""Help... please..."" the figure called out, collapsing a few feet from their camp.

Thomas and Cecelia rushed to the stranger's side. It was a young woman, her clothes tattered and her face gaunt with exhaustion. As they helped her to the campfire, she handed Thomas a small, weathered notebook.

""Found... this... in the ruins,"" she gasped before losing consciousness.

Thomas opened the notebook, his eyes widening as he recognized the handwriting. It was his own, from years ago, before the Event. Flipping through the pages, he found detailed notes about celestial observations, but more importantly, a series of entries about a secret project he had been working on—a project to communicate with a hidden colony of survivors.

""Cecelia, look at this,"" Thomas said, his voice shaking. ""I had forgotten all about this. We were working on a way to find other survivors, to rebuild.""

Cecelia's face paled as she read the entries. ""Thomas, there's something you need to know. I wasn't just a trader. I was sent to find you. My mission was to ensure you remembered this project. The Free Republic of Colorado needs this information to reconnect with other survivor colonies.""

Thomas stared at her, the pieces falling into place. ""So, you knew all along?""

Cecelia nodded, tears welling up in her eyes. ""I didn't remember everything until now. But I knew you were important. We were part of the same team before the Event. We were working together to save humanity.""

The revelation hit Thomas like a tidal wave. The celestial observations, the survival, the companionship—it all made sense now. They had a purpose, a mission that transcended their immediate survival.

""We need to get this information to the Free Republic,"" Thomas said, determination in his voice. ""It's our only chance to rebuild.""

As they prepared to set out, the young woman stirred, her eyes fluttering open. ""Thank you,"" she whispered. ""You have no idea how important this is.""

With renewed purpose, Thomas and Cecelia packed their belongings, ready to embark on a journey that would change the course of their lives and the future of humanity. The stars above, once a source of solace, now guided them towards a new beginning.

","As the sun climbed higher, casting long shadows across the desolate landscape, a distant rumble broke the morning's stillness. Thomas stirred, his eyes fluttering open. He glanced at the clock on the RV's dashboard—barely an hour had passed since he had drifted off. The rumble grew louder, more insistent, and Thomas's heart quickened. He scrambled out of bed, his mind racing with possibilities.

""Cecelia, wake up!"" he called, shaking her shoulder. She groaned, rubbing her eyes as she sat up.

""What is it?"" she mumbled, still groggy from sleep.

""Listen,"" Thomas said, his voice tense. ""Do you hear that?""

Cecelia strained her ears, and the rumble became unmistakable. It was the sound of engines—multiple engines—approaching fast. Panic surged through her as she leaped out of bed, her instincts screaming danger.

""Traders?"" she asked, though she knew the answer. The sound was too aggressive, too coordinated.

""Raiders,"" Thomas confirmed, his face pale. ""We need to hide.""

They scrambled to gather their most valuable possessions—food, water, the telescope—and shoved them into a hidden compartment beneath the RV's floor. The engines grew louder, and Thomas's hands trembled as he secured the hatch.

""Get down,"" he whispered, pulling Cecelia to the floor. They lay flat, their breaths shallow, as the roar of engines enveloped them.

The RV shook as the raiders' vehicles surrounded it. Thomas and Cecelia could hear muffled voices, the clinking of metal, and the unmistakable sound of boots hitting the ground. The tension was suffocating, each second stretching into an eternity.

Suddenly, the RV's door was yanked open, and heavy footsteps thudded inside. Thomas held his breath, praying they wouldn't be discovered. The raiders rummaged through the RV, their frustration evident in their grunts and curses.

""Nothing here,"" one of them growled. ""Just a bunch of junk.""

""Check outside,"" another voice commanded. ""They can't be far.""

The footsteps retreated, and the door slammed shut. Thomas and Cecelia remained motionless, their ears straining to catch any sound. Minutes passed, feeling like hours, before the engines roared to life again. The raiders' vehicles sped away, leaving a cloud of dust in their wake.

Thomas exhaled, his body trembling with relief. ""They're gone,"" he whispered, helping Cecelia to her feet.

""That was too close,"" she said, her voice shaky. ""We need to be more careful.""

As they emerged from their hiding place, Thomas noticed something glinting in the morning sun. It was a small, metallic object lying on the ground where the raiders had parked. He picked it up, his eyes widening in shock.

""Cecelia, look at this,"" he said, holding the object out to her. It was a military dog tag, the name and serial number barely legible.

""Where did you find that?"" she asked, her brow furrowing.

""Right here,"" Thomas replied. ""It must have fallen off one of the raiders.""

Cecelia examined the dog tag, her eyes narrowing. ""This name... it's familiar. I think I've seen it before.""

Thomas's mind raced, piecing together fragments of memory. ""Wait,"" he said, his voice urgent. ""Remember the stories about the secret military base near Denver? The one that was supposed to be a safe haven after the Event?""

Cecelia's eyes widened. ""You think these raiders are connected to that base?""

""It's possible,"" Thomas said, his excitement growing. ""If we can find that base, we might find more than just safety. We could find answers—about the Event, about what really happened.""

Cecelia nodded, her resolve hardening. ""Then we need to find it. But we have to be careful. If the raiders are looking for it too, it won't be easy.""

Thomas agreed, a sense of purpose igniting within him. The discovery of the dog tag had transformed their bleak existence into a quest for truth. As they prepared to leave, the stars above seemed to shine a little brighter, guiding them toward a future filled with hope and possibility.

Little did they know, the journey ahead would reveal secrets that would change everything they thought they knew about the world—and themselves.","As dawn broke over the desolate terrain, Thomas surveyed the surrounding wilderness from within his beloved RV—a relic of times gone by. The once gleaming exterior now wore a patina of neglect, its once glossy surface dulled to a rust-tinged yellow as if tinged with the dust and soot of years past. His fingers danced over every inch of his cherished space—the RV, their fortress amidst chaos.

""Sky's filled with stars,"" Cecelia mumbled from her makeshift bed, her voice carrying a tinge of longing wrapped in indifference. ""Purely decorative now."" Her words hung there, an echo of the world they had left behind—one that no longer cared for beauty or dreams beyond survival.

""Yet their light remains,"" Thomas whispered back, his gaze fixed upon the celestial sphere above. His fascination with the cosmos was as boundless as the void between the stars. ""In a world where luxuries are scarce, we should treasure these moments."" He watched her drift off to sleep while he continued to observe the heavens—their own private observatory in this desolate reality.

The RV stood steadfast and resilient amidst the backdrop of a ravaged world, its insides as neatly organized as ever thanks to Thomas's meticulous nature. The stark contrast between the chaos outside and the order within was not lost on him—it served both as an anchor in their unpredictable lives and a poignant reminder of the life he once knew.

Morning found them waking to another day, with Cecelia nestled into her makeshift bed while Thomas busied himself atop the RV's creaky countertop. With precise movements born from memory and habit, he cooked an omelette using a pan forged in times of prosperity now repurposed as their primary cooking utensil. Each crackle that accompanied the eggs was like a whisper from the old world—a reminder of its lingering presence in every corner of this new existence.

""Potatoes! We're nearly out,"" Thomas announced, his tone carrying an urgency sharpened by necessity. ""Only canned ones left."" His voice held a hint of resignation to their constrained reality but also a spark of hope that refused to die down. The bear-shaped teddy that Cecelia had once fashioned with her brother's help—a remnant from happier days—looked on, its button eyes reflecting the dim light in an ever-watchful vigil.

As they lay there, surrendering to the lull of sleep brought by the day’s exertions and nightmares yet unspoken, Thomas pondered over his dwindling supplies. With a sigh, he ventured outside where coyotes roamed in search of sustenance and deer foraged through the scarce vegetation—a poignant reminder that life persisted despite everything.

Savoring each bite with an appreciation cultivated from hardship, Thomas found solace in small joys: a well-cooked meal, a moment of peace, and the silent companionship of Cecelia's breathing form as she rested within their sanctuary—a haven amidst devastation. The RV was more than a shelter; it was their past woven with memories and fortitude, each object inside carrying stories that fueled their resolve to endure another day in this altered reality.","h p z f"

Hey Andy,

Just letting you know that I can’t make your BBQ this weekend. I was looking forward to having a few beers with you and the guys and maybe playing a few hands of poker once the eating is done, but I have to head to Albany in the morning.

Remember my Uncle Arthur? Don’t worry, I don’t either. (Well, a little.) Anyway, he passed away a few days ago and his sister - my Aunt Bonnie out in Wisconsin - contacted me this morning to inform me that he left “certain assets” to me in his will. Most intriguing! I won’t know the details for a while but Bonnie begged me to go to his house in Albany right away to take care of his cats and locate some important documents in his library. (My recently-deceased uncle who named me in his will was wealthy enough to have a personal library? The plot thickens…)

Anyway, I’m packing a bag and planning to stay up there for a little while to help manage affairs at the house and work with Bonnie on the local funeral arrangements while she lines up a flight over the next few days. Not much else to do at the moment as I await my next work assignment but I should be back by this time next week. In the meantime, you know how to reach me. Tell the boys I said hola.

Hey Andy,

Greetings from gloomy Albany! Hasn’t stopped raining since I got here. Also, I’m fairly certain these cats are plotting my demise. Other than that, things are fine and the house is basically a smallish mansion.

Listen to this, while searching for the documents that my Aunt Bonnie asked me to find for her in the library I found some really interesting old books. I think we might have some pretty rare first editions here, plus some other really strange stuff. I need to do a little web research tonight to try to figure out what I’m looking at but I’ll let you know. 

As a newly-minted Ivy League literature professor I thought you would be interested. Maybe I will come home with a copy of In Cold Blood signed by Capote for you?

In addition to Capote’s In Cold Blood, so far I have already found four more signed first edition iconic novels; Heart of Darkness, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Illustrated Man and - hold on to your hat here - A Tale of Two Cities! No telling if the autographs are legit but I don’t know why my uncle would be hoarding counterfeit-signed copies in his home library. More research necessary here but I have attached photos of the covers, bindings and the author-signed pages in each.

The library has floor-to-ceiling shelves full of books on three walls and I have only checked out about a third of them so far. Stay tuned!

Hey Jamie,

Okay listen. Just give me the Dickens novel and not only will I cancel the $80 Venmo request, but golf is on me for the rest of the year. I think that’s a fair deal.

Seriously man, I just did a quick bit of Googling here and those books do look like legit first edition copies and the signatures look right too. Usually people take these sort of things to Sotheby’s or Christie’s, where they employ rare book experts who can authenticate them properly. Even if they’re not going to be put up for sale this is probably a good idea, just to officially document these historical items.

Can’t wait to hear what you find next. I’m seriously on the edge of my seat here!

Andy,

Forget about the signed first editions. I am into some strange new terrain here.

Yesterday I found a number of extremely interesting books way up on one of the top shelves I hadn’t explored yet. Listen to this. I found a copy of For Whom The Bell Tolls by William Faulkner. Yes, William Faulkner! And it wasn’t just a different author’s name transposed onto the cover. It was the same third-person omniscient narrative of the Spanish Civil War, only it wasn’t written in the short staccato sentence styles and brief paragraphing of Hemingway but the long, leisurely prose of Faulkner. I’m not even a fan of Faulkner and I couldn’t put it down!

Similarly, I also found a copy of The Catcher in the Rye by Dalton Trumbo and The Iliad by EE Cummings! (Seriously, I can’t make this up.) Still so many more books to look through. I am simply overwhelmed here. Stay tuned.

Hey Andy,

You’re right. I have been negligent in my funeral arrangement duties of late. I accidentally let my phone battery die out, not sure when. The truth is that I haven’t slept much in the last few days. This continues to get more and more fascinating.

And no, I wasn’t kidding about those strange books I mentioned in my last message. But never mind that. I am into some truly bizarre territory now. I found some old 3-ring binders filled with dot matrix printed files listing the daily opening and closing numbers of each of the stocks contained in the Dow Jones Industrial Index running from January 1, 1977 through December 31, 2026. Andy, it has accurate stock performance data through the end of 2026! I’m sure you think I am kidding again (or maybe just crazy) but I have been watching those stock prices over the last few days and my God man they are accurate right down to the last decimal point!

You think I’m joking? Here’s a random selection for tomorrow for you to check out. Merck & Co. (ticker symbol NYSE: MRK) will open the trading day at $154.34 and it will close at $156.12 per share with a total of 7.126 million shares in overall trading volume. I’m sure you won’t but you can literally bet the house on it. I guarantee it.

Jamie,

I don’t know what to say at this point. I have been thinking about this since the market closed about 5 hours ago and I have no idea how you were able to make that prediction with such accuracy. I would call it dumb luck but I actually opened up Excel and took the time to do a little statistical modeling and what I found was that a stock prediction with that level of precision is basically like calling out the next day’s lottery numbers. Not quite that improbable but close enough that I am simply baffled.

I need answers, because I just can’t believe you found an old set of stock market printouts from almost 50 years ago that can perfectly predict what will happen tomorrow. I’ve tried to call you several times but it goes straight to vmail every time and your mailbox is full. You gotta get back to me asap. I don’t think I’m going to be able to sleep until you do.

Funeral plans? Still a concern?

Hey Andy,

Forget about the stock market. Forget about the rare first edition signed books. Those things are trivial. At least for now. 

I just found a medical manual that seems to contain advanced diagnostic techniques and curative/surgical treatments for most common, and some uncommon, forms of cancer and various other deadly diseases. I am only about halfway through it and without the benefit of a medical background it is taking me forever to research the basic terminology needed just to understand this even on a rudimentary level, but if it’s true it’s an incredible discovery and I owe it to the world to get this into the right hands once I can at least confirm its basic legitimacy. 

I can’t say when I will be able to call you or even write back since my time is so limited now. I don’t see this changing anytime soon. Who knows what I will find next? So much more to still be explored. I can’t worry about the funeral arrangements right now either. Before my phone died I got a message from my Aunt Bonnie saying that she had some health problems that were preventing her from flying in. I can’t remember the details but that’s just going to have to wait for now. I have far more important concerns at this point.

- Jamie

p.s. I have discovered a number of old hand-written notes, presumably penned by my late Uncle Arthur, warning anyone who comes across these documents against sharing them in any way. The writing is rambling and paranoid in nature and some of the warnings give me pause but how could anyone possibly just sit on all this? It would be immoral, no?

Hi Andy,

I let the cats out a few days ago when all of the remaining cat food ran out. Don’t think I’ve seen them since. Not sure. They should be okay. It’s summer.

Dude, you wouldn’t even believe what I’m looking at now. No time to explain but I will get back to you when I can. Not planning to head home anytime soon.

p.s. Please see the attached file containing stock market data for the next two years. I just ask that you don’t share this with anyone else. “Law of Unintended Consequences” and all that.

I’m sorry for the confusion. I should have been clearer. Yes, I’ve discovered something extraordinary. The documents I found in Uncle Arthur’s library were not just about stock markets or medical advancements. They included detailed instructions on manipulating time itself. 

I’ve been living in different eras, gathering knowledge and understanding the implications of these discoveries. I’ve seen the future, Andy. I’ve seen things that would blow your mind. But I can’t return to our present time. The paradoxes and consequences are too great. 

I’ve left instructions for you in a safe deposit box at the Albany National Bank. The key is hidden in the old oak tree in my uncle’s backyard. Follow the instructions carefully. It’s crucial for the future.

Take care, my friend.

Anders sat back in his chair, the weight of Jamie’s words sinking in. He had to go to Albany. He had to find the key. As he packed his bag, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this was just the beginning of something much larger than he could ever have imagined. 

Little did he know, Jamie’s final message was not just a farewell but a warning. The instructions in the safe deposit box would lead Andy to a discovery that would change the course of history, and he would soon find himself entangled in a web of time, secrets, and unimaginable power.","<brainstorm>

1. **Time Travel Twist**: Jamie has discovered a way to travel through time using the documents and books in his uncle's library. The stock market data and medical manual are from the future, and Jamie is now living in a different time period.

2. **Parallel Universe**: The books and documents Jamie found are from a parallel universe where different authors wrote famous books, and the stock market data is from that universe. Jamie has somehow crossed over into this parallel universe.

3. **Uncle's Secret Society**: Jamie's uncle was part of a secret society that had access to advanced knowledge and technology. The library is a repository of this knowledge, and Jamie is now being inducted into the society.

4. **Mental Breakdown**: Jamie is experiencing a mental breakdown, and the strange books and documents are a result of his deteriorating mental state. The emails are his way of trying to make sense of his confusion.

5. **Simulation Theory**: Jamie discovers that he is living in a simulated reality, and the books and documents are glitches or clues left by the creators of the simulation. He is now trying to understand the nature of his existence.

6. **Uncle's Experiment**: Jamie's uncle was a scientist conducting an experiment on reality and perception. The library is part of this experiment, and Jamie is now a subject in it, experiencing altered realities.

As Andy closed his laptop, he couldn’t shake the feeling that his life was about to change forever. He packed a bag and headed to Albany, determined to find the device Jamie had mentioned. 

When he arrived at the house, it was eerily quiet. He made his way to the library and found the hidden compartment behind the third shelf. Inside was a small, ornate pocket watch. As he held it in his hand, he felt a strange sensation, as if time itself was bending around him.

Suddenly, the watch began to glow, and Andy felt a pull, like he was being drawn into another dimension. The room around him blurred, and he found himself standing in a vast, futuristic cityscape. 

A figure approached him, and as it came into focus, Andy’s heart skipped a beat. It was Jamie, but older, wiser, and with a look of determination in his eyes.

“Welcome to the future, Andy,” Jamie said, a smile spreading across his face. “We have a lot of work to do.”

And with that, Andy realized that his friend had not only discovered the secrets of time travel but had also unlocked the potential to change the course of history. Together, they would embark on a journey that would redefine the very fabric of reality."," Dear Anders, 

I understand your concern, and I appreciate it very much. As to the medical manuals in question - they indeed seem promising but require careful analysis before we can discuss their implications more thoroughly. I'll get right on this when things settle down a bit at my end. In terms of those stock predictions you’ve shared with me, while interesting, it would be unwise to treat them as gospel truth without substantial validation through market and economic factors which could influence the prices. However, they might serve as an interesting data point for our research project on historical patterns in stock markets.

As far as my feline friends are concerned, I hope your search is fruitful!","z p f h"
"6",6,"A Hidden Truth Between the Pages",6,256,"5/24/2024","Carlton closed the most suspenseful, thrilling, murder mystery book he ever read. He found it just thumbing through the stacks at the local library. My Smile Hides My Evil Ways, was a book title that Carlton couldn’t resist. Reading the opening sentence hooked him. Carlton sat down in an armchair, next thing he knew eight hours passed and he had finished the book. The description of the murder, all the emotions felt so real to him. It was exactly the kind of story he always dreamed of writing.

           Carlton was an aspiring author himself. He wrote his first short story in junior high, and had been writing ever since. Carlton was good at describing emotions. The characters he creates are captivating. His vocabulary and writing technic are masterful, but he struggled with the plot. He just couldn’t think of a great story. And that was the main critique of his work when he tried to get it published. So Carlton spent all his free time attending workshops. Joining writing groups. And reading the kind of books he wanted to write. Which led him to My Smile Hides My Evil Ways. This Story inspired him like no other book had. It opened his mind to a new way to write a story. He had to meet the author, Martin Wayne Dickey.

           After being forced out the library because they were closing, Carlton pulled out his phone and googled the author. He was surprised to see that Dickey was in town for an author signing and speaking engagement that Saturday.  

           Excited, Carlton was first in line that Saturday morning to buy a book and have it signed by Martin Wayne Dickey. Dickey looked the part of an eccentric writer with wild grey hair that looked like God was pulling it in every direction. His face was adorned with a pair of black horn-rimmed glasses that made him look quirky. And just to add on to his cliché look, he was wearing corduroy pants, a sweater vest, and wingtip shoes.

           Carlton flashed a school boy smile as he handed Dickey his book. Then the words came stumbling out his mouth, “Mr. Dickey, it’s a pleasure to meet you. You are my favorite writer.”

           “Is that right,” Dickey said. His words sounded routine and rehearsed. He took Carlton’s book without looking up and signed it. Then he flashed a grin that was as phony as a Gucci purse on Canal Street in New York, “I’m glad you enjoyed it.”

           “Mr. Dickey, this book changed my life,” Carlton proclaimed as he took back his autograph novel and stood there like a statue.

           Dickey raised his head and locked eyes with Carlton. “How so?”

           Carlton shyly bowed his head as he gathered up the courage to speak his truth, “I’m an aspiring writer. I want to write crime fiction like you. And the way you write, it’s almost like you were there, watching the events of your book unfold. Like in chapter 12 when Peter finds out his business partner has been stealing from him for years. And he sneaks into his house, puts him to sleep with chloroform. Places him in the bathtub, and slits his wrist to make it look like suicide.  It’s like nothing I’ve ever read before. The details……wow. I would love to pick your brain.”

           Dickey nodded his head, “I didn’t know my story moved anybody like that.”

           “Oh yes sir. You are gifted. You wouldn’t happen to be teaching any classes on your technic? I would love to learn from you,” Carlton said as he cradled his book in his arms like it was a sacred artifact.

           Dickey looked at the long line that was forming behind Carlton, and he reached into his wallet and handed Carlton a business card, “I tell you what. I’m going to be in town until Monday. Why don’t you give me call. I’m staying at the Plaza downtown. We can setup a time to meet and have drinks. Maybe we can both get some inspiration.”

           Carlton thanked him and slithered his way through the crowd that was now out the door. As he walked toward the parking garage to get his car, Carlton pulled up Martin Wayne Dickey’s Wikipedia page. It wasn’t much there. Dickey seemed to be an over night sensation with no college degree or previous work before this last book. So Carlton got to thinking, if he can do it so can I.

 When he made it home, Carlton turned on his computer and pulled up the book he’d been working on. But he was stuck in the same spot for weeks. Typing the same sentence over and over again. Hoping an idea would come. Just like Jack Torrance from the movie, The Shining. But once again he couldn’t come up with a storyline to save his life. He took that business card out of pocket and called Dickey. They agreed to meet up.

That next night Carlton showed up at the bar in the Plaza at 8pm sharp. After an hour of searching for the right thing to wear, Carlton decided to emulate his new favorite author. He slipped on some khakis, button-down shirt with a sweater draped over it, and some loafers. Stepping inside, Carlton saw that Dickey was already there. Sitting on a stool at the end of the bar. He raised a glass when he saw Carlton.

           “What you drinking….” Dickey asked as he snapped his finger, “I didn’t catch your name earlier.”

           “It’s Carlton, Carlton Maxwell, sir,” he said taking a seat next to him.

           “No sir necessary. My friends call me, Marty.”

           “Okay, Marty. I’ll have whatever your drinking.”

           Dickey motioned to the bartender, “Can you bring my friend here a warm cognac.” Then Dickey turned toward Carlton and said, “So Carlton, tell me a little about yourself.”

           “Not much to tell. I’m from Jackson, Mississippi. The oldest of five kids. My father is a truck driver and my momma stays at home and runs the house. I graduated from high school and went to junior college for a couple of years. I majored in computer science. But for one of my electives, I took a creative writing class. And that class opened my eyes about storytelling. I couldn’t wait until Tuesday and Thursdays to write a new story. I’d walked around the campus daydreaming all the time about different ideas. I never knew going to a class like that would be so fun. It didn’t feel like work. Anyway, I started working in the oil fields during the summer to pay for my classes. The money was so good, I quit school and worked fulltime. And that’s why I’m here. Boring right?”

           “Maybe, maybe not. So, how much did that oil field pay you to give up on your dreams?” Dickey asked while taking a sip.

           “fifty-thousand,” Carlton said with a grimace.

“You’re better than me. I only got thirty-thousand to be a salesman.”

The bartender handed Carlton his drink. And Dickey raised his glass for a toast, “To dreams, and the suckers that sell them.”

They shared a laughed as they took a swig.

“So, how did go from being a salesman to a best-selling author?” Carlton asked as he blocked out the chatter from the bar and focused on every word Dickey said.

Dickey stared at his drink as he swirled it around. “Embrace my darker side,” he responded with a devilish grin.

The wheels were spinning in Carlton’s head as he tried to understand. “Embrace the dark side?”

 “If you’re going to write crime fiction, you have to step into the shoes of someone who is willing to do such brutal acts. Think like they think. Act like they act. It’s the only way you’ll ever connect with that kind of person.”

Nodding his head, Carlton leaned in and asked, “And how do you do that? What’s your secret? How do you come up with such graphic and detailed stories?”

Dickey smiled and took another sip before finally responding, “You’re not ready yet.”

Carlton shook his head in disagreement as he explained, “I have tried everything. I’ve attended workshops. I took classes at the community college. I joined writing groups. I read a book a week to familiarize myself with the different writing styles. I’ve left no stone unturned.”

“Really,” Dickey said with a raised eyebrow.

“Yes sir. And I’ll do anything to learn how to write like you,” Carlton said sitting on the edge of his seat.

“Anything?” Dickey said turning to face Carlton as he peered deep into his eyes.

“Anything.”

Dickey bit down on his bottom lip and glanced up at the ceiling in deep thought. Then he looked both ways before leaning in close and saying in a soft voice, “I have a secret. A…. unique way of coming up with my content.”

Carlton was so eager for the info, he almost slid off his barstool.

Dickey continued, “I improv a conflict, record it, and use the dialog and feelings to write my stories.”

Carlton’s face scrunched up as he said, “I don’t follow.”

Dickey set his drink down and rolled up his sleeves. “I’ll give you an example. Pretend that you just found out I was sleeping with your wife. You tracked me down at this bar. What would you do? What would you say?”

“I’d snatch you by the shirt and throw you into that table over there. Then I’d say I know you’ve been sleeping with my damn wife!”

“Exactly! You see how natural that reaction was. You didn’t have to think about it. It just came you.”

“Yeah,” Carlton said nodding his head. 

“I would record that scene and use it to write my story.”

“I see your point. I would’ve never thought of that.”

Dickey smiled and asked, “You know I’ve been looking for someone just like you. Somebody who’s passionate, open minded, and willing do anything for a good story.”

“I’m your guy,” Carlton said grinning ear to ear.

 “I’ve had a new idea for a book. And I’ve been waiting for the right time to try out a new scene. Why don’t you come to my room and work on it with me? Then you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about. And maybe it’ll help you to develop you own idea.”

“That would be great! Let’s do it.”

Carlton followed Dickey up to his room. The lavish presidential suite had a living room, dining room, and a full kitchen. It was the biggest hotel room Carlton ever saw. Even the fragrance was exotic and delightful, some kind of sandal wood and jasmine mix. And the view of downtown was breathtaking. But Carlton wasn’t there for any of that.

Dickey ran his fingers through his hair as he cleared his throat and said, “So check it out. We’re going to pretend that you came here to discuss a business deal. A merger let’s say. And you’re going to hit on me.”

“Wait, I’m gay in this scenario?” Carlton asked with raised eyebrows.

“Relax, we’re not fixing to make out. You’re just pretending. Then I’m going to get upset with you. And we’re going to go back and forth. Then I’m going to pretend to hit you. And we’re going to improv the whole thing. Like you did in the lobby. Whatever comes natural. Makes sense?” Dickey explained as he pulled out his phone and turned on the recorder.

“I get it,” Carlton said as he rubbed his chin. Closing his eyes, he imagined the scenario in his head. And when it finally came to him, his eyes popped open and he assumed a position at the front door. He pretended to come in.

“Marty, I got the paperwork in my briefcase for you to sign,” Carlton said walking over to the dining room table and setting down an imaginary briefcase.

“Excellent. A month’s worth of work finally done.”

“Yes,” Carlton said as he slid behind Dickey and patted him on his shoulder. “I enjoyed working closely with you. Matter of fact, I think we should celebrate our new deal. What do you say about going out to dinner?”

“Yeah a nice team dinner sounds great. It would be a great reward for the staff and all the hard work they put in,” Dickey said pretending to sign the documents.

“Well, I was thinking of a dinner with just you and me. Something a little more intimate. I know of a nice Italian spot. Out of the way. Very discrete.”  

Dickey turned around with venom in his eyes and a vein bulging in his forehead. He snapped, “Are you coming on to me?”

“You’ve been sending my signals all week,” Carlton said.

“Your signals are off. I’m not gay,” Dickey snapped.

“C’mon,” Carlton replied with a sly grin and a wink. “I’ve seen the way you’ve looked at me. It’s okay. Nobody has to know. It could be our dirty little secret.”

“The only secret you’re going to keep; is how badly I’ll kick your ass if you don’t get the hell out of my damn house!”  

He threw his hands up with a sarcastic smile and said, “Careful who you threaten, Marty. I might have to tell somebody what went on here tonight.”

“You son of a bitch!” Dickey snapped as he reached for a steak knife from the dining room table.  

Carlton was impressed at Dickey’s intensity. This dude can act his ass off, Carlton thought to himself. He didn’t know that Dickey could be this passionate. This would make for an incredible scene. He quickly realized how effective this improv thing could be. In that short moment, Carlton had his first idea of an improv he could do. 

","

Unfortunately, he was so distracted, he didn’t realize that Dickey stabbed him in the gut with that steak knife. The shock hit him before the pain did. His eyes almost popped out of his head as they darted back and forth between his gut and Dickey holding the bloody knife.

“Why the hell did you stab me?” Carlton said as he stumbled backward and landed in one of the dining room chairs.

“I let you in on part of my secret. I do improv. But what I didn’t tell you is, while you’re acting it’s real for me.”

“You really slit somebody wrist and made it look like suicide?” Carlton asked, scared as hell.

“Only way to set that scene. It worked. It made you my biggest fan,” Dickey revealed as he crept closure wielding the knife.

“You won’t get away with this,” Carlton replied as his breathing became labored.

“That’s what they all say. But I’ve been planning this scene out for months. I’ll wheel your thin body out is my luggage. Right pass the front desk. And nobody will even notice. Cheer up. At least you’ll get what you came for. The story of a lifetime,” Dickey said as he put his hand over Carlton’s mouth and stabbed him repeatedly until he stopped moving.

A year later Dickey went out to his front porch to retrieve a package the mailman dropped off. He opened the box and pulled out the first copy of his new book inspired by Carlton called, The Down Low killer.","Dickey lunged at Carlton with the knife, and Carlton instinctively dodged, knocking over a chair in the process. The clatter echoed through the suite, but Carlton was too engrossed in the scene to care. He grabbed a wine bottle from the table and held it up defensively.

""Whoa, Marty! That’s a bit too real!"" Carlton exclaimed, his heart pounding.

Dickey paused, his eyes narrowing. ""You wanted real, didn’t you? This is what it takes to write a bestseller.""

Carlton hesitated, then nodded, lowering the bottle slightly. ""Okay, okay. I get it. Let’s keep going.""

Dickey smirked and continued, ""You think you can blackmail me? You have no idea who you’re dealing with.""

Carlton, now fully immersed in the role, responded, ""I know exactly who I’m dealing with. A man with secrets. Dark secrets.""

Dickey’s eyes gleamed with a sinister light. ""You have no idea how dark.""

Suddenly, the door to the suite burst open, and two men in suits stormed in, guns drawn. ""Freeze! FBI!""

Carlton’s jaw dropped. ""What the hell is going on?""

One of the agents grabbed Dickey, slamming him against the wall. ""Martin Wayne Dickey, you’re under arrest for the murder of Peter Collins.""

Carlton’s mind raced. ""Peter Collins? The character from the book?""

The agent turned to Carlton. ""That wasn’t fiction, son. Dickey here has been writing about his real-life murders. We’ve been tracking him for months.""

Dickey laughed maniacally. ""You wanted to know my secret, Carlton? There it is. I live my stories.""

Carlton staggered back, the room spinning. ""But... but the book...""

The agent nodded grimly. ""Every detail in that book is a confession. We just needed someone to get close enough to confirm it.""

Carlton’s stomach churned. He had idolized a monster. ""I... I didn’t know.""

The agent patted Carlton on the shoulder. ""You helped us catch him. That’s what matters.""

As they led Dickey away, he turned to Carlton one last time. ""Remember, Carlton. To write the best stories, you have to live them.""

Carlton watched in stunned silence as the door closed behind them. He looked down at the business card Dickey had given him, now crumpled in his trembling hand. The words echoed in his mind: ""Embrace the dark side.""

He realized then that he didn’t need to live the darkness to write about it. He just needed to understand it. And he had seen enough darkness tonight to last a lifetime.","<brainstorm>
1. **Dickey's True Identity**: Dickey is not actually the author of the book. He stole the manuscript from someone else, and his ""improv"" method is a way to cover up his lack of genuine writing talent.
2. **Carlton's Dark Side**: Carlton, inspired by Dickey's method, ends up committing a real crime to get authentic material for his writing, only to find out that Dickey has been manipulating him all along.
3. **The Book's Origin**: The book ""My Smile Hides My Evil Ways"" is actually based on real events that Dickey was involved in, and he uses his writing to relive his crimes.
4. **Dickey's Manipulation**: Dickey uses his ""improv"" method to manipulate aspiring writers into committing crimes, which he then uses as material for his books.
5. **A Deadly Improv**: The improv session turns deadly, revealing that Dickey has a history of luring writers into dangerous situations for his own amusement and inspiration.

Combining elements from these ideas, the best twist would be to reveal that Dickey has been manipulating aspiring writers into committing real crimes, which he then uses as material for his books. This twist recontextualizes Dickey's eccentric behavior and his ""improv"" method, providing a dark and satisfying resolution to the story.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
Carlton's heart raced as he watched Dickey's intense performance. The knife in Dickey's hand gleamed under the suite's ambient lighting, and for a moment, Carlton felt a genuine pang of fear. But he reminded himself it was all part of the act.

""You're really good at this,"" Carlton said, breaking character for a moment. ""I can see how this method works.""

Dickey's eyes softened, and he set the knife down, a sly smile creeping across his face. ""I'm glad you think so. But there's something you should know, Carlton.""

Carlton's curiosity piqued. ""What's that?""

Dickey leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""You're not the first aspiring writer I've taken under my wing. And you won't be the last.""

Carlton's brow furrowed. ""What do you mean?""

Dickey's smile widened, a sinister glint in his eyes. ""Every book I've written, every gruesome detail, comes from real-life events. Events that I've orchestrated with the help of eager writers like yourself.""

Carlton's blood ran cold. ""You mean...?""

""Yes,"" Dickey interrupted. ""I manipulate writers into committing real crimes, all in the name of 'improv.' They think it's just an exercise, but it's far more than that. It's my way of getting authentic material.""

Carlton's mind raced, piecing together the implications. ""So, the murder in your book...?""

""Was real,"" Dickey confirmed. ""And the writer who helped me with that scene is now serving a life sentence, none the wiser that I was the puppet master.""

Carlton's stomach churned. He had walked into a trap, just like the others. ""Why are you telling me this?""

Dickey's expression turned cold. ""Because I need a new story, Carlton. And you're going to help me write it.""

Carlton's eyes darted to the door, but Dickey's hand was already on the knife again. ""Don't even think about it,"" Dickey warned. ""You're in too deep now.""

Realizing the gravity of his situation, Carlton's mind raced for a way out. ""What if I refuse?""

Dickey chuckled darkly. ""You won't. Because if you do, I'll make sure you're the next character in my book. And trust me, it won't end well for you.""

Carlton's heart pounded in his chest as he weighed his options. He had come seeking inspiration, but he had found something far more sinister. With no other choice, he nodded slowly. ""Alright, Marty. Let's write a story.""

Dickey's smile returned, but this time, it was genuine. ""Good. Now, let's get started.""

As Carlton followed Dickey's lead, he couldn't help but wonder if he would ever escape this twisted game. But one thing was certain: he would never look at crime fiction the same way again.

","Dickey lunged at Carlton with the knife, and Carlton instinctively dodged, his heart pounding. The scene felt so real, the adrenaline so palpable, that for a moment, Carlton forgot it was all an act. He stumbled backward, knocking over a chair, and Dickey's eyes gleamed with a manic intensity.

""Whoa, Marty! That was intense!"" Carlton said, trying to catch his breath. ""You really got into it.""

Dickey lowered the knife, his expression softening into a smile. ""That's the point, Carlton. You have to live the scene, feel it in your bones. Only then can you write it convincingly.""

Carlton nodded, still shaken but exhilarated. ""I get it now. This is amazing. I can't wait to try it out in my own writing.""

Dickey poured them both another drink, and they toasted to their newfound partnership. As the night wore on, they discussed more ideas, each more thrilling than the last. Carlton felt like he was on the brink of a breakthrough, his mind buzzing with possibilities.

Eventually, the night wound down, and Carlton thanked Dickey for the invaluable lesson. ""I can't tell you how much this means to me, Marty. You've really opened my eyes.""

Dickey smiled, a glint of something unreadable in his eyes. ""I'm glad I could help. Remember, Carlton, the best stories come from the darkest places within us.""

Carlton left the hotel, his mind racing with excitement. He couldn't wait to get home and start writing. He felt like he had finally found the key to unlocking his potential.

The next morning, Carlton woke up early, eager to put his newfound knowledge to the test. He sat at his computer, fingers flying over the keyboard as he poured his heart and soul into his story. The words flowed effortlessly, each scene more vivid and intense than the last. For the first time in his life, he felt like a true writer.

Days turned into weeks, and Carlton's manuscript grew. He sent it off to a publisher, and to his astonishment, they loved it. They wanted to publish his book. Carlton was over the moon. He owed it all to Dickey and that fateful night at the Plaza.

On the day of his book launch, Carlton stood in front of a crowd of eager readers, signing copies and answering questions. He felt like he was living a dream. As the event wound down, a man approached him, holding a copy of My Smile Hides My Evil Ways.

""Excuse me, Mr. Maxwell,"" the man said. ""I couldn't help but notice the similarities between your book and Martin Wayne Dickey's work. Did he mentor you?""

Carlton smiled, ready to share his story. ""Yes, he did. He taught me everything I know about writing crime fiction.""

The man's expression turned serious. ""That's interesting because Martin Wayne Dickey was found dead in his hotel room the night after your meeting. The police ruled it a suicide, but there were some... unusual circumstances.""

Carlton's blood ran cold. ""What do you mean?""

The man leaned in, his voice low. ""They found a recording on his phone. It was an improv scene, just like the one you described. But in this one, he was the victim. And the killer? Well, the voice sounded an awful lot like yours.""

Carlton's heart pounded in his chest. He remembered the intensity of that night, the way Dickey had pushed him to embrace his darker side. Had he gone too far? Had he somehow become the very thing he was trying to write about?

As the man walked away, Carlton felt a chill run down his spine. He looked down at the book in his hands, the title now taking on a sinister new meaning. My Smile Hides My Evil Ways. He had thought it was just a story, but now he wasn't so sure.","
Dickey, with knife still raised but not yet lunged forward, paused—caught up momentarily by his own fervor. He took a breath as Carlton's words sank in. The tension that had built up dissipated slowly like fog under the morning sun. ""You know what? Maybe there's something to this improv thing,"" Dickey admitted reluctantly, lowering the knife and exhaling deeply.

Carlton nodded vigorously, his face alight with excitement. “See, it’s all about tapping into that raw emotion. It doesn't have to be real—it just has to feel real.”

Dickey rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, still processing what had just happened. ""I suppose you can start us off then,"" he said, gesturing for Carlton to take the lead in their role-playing exercise.

Carlton cleared his throat and straightened up, taking on a more serious demeanor as if preparing for a scene. “Marty,” he began with an air of urgency, “I need your help with something.” He paused for dramatic effect, eyeing Dickey intently. ""There's been a breach in security at our company. I think someone close to us is leaking confidential information.""

Dickey’s eyes narrowed as he considered the scenario. “Leaks happen,” he replied coolly, though his curiosity was piqued. “But why come to me?”

“Because you're smart, Marty,"" Carlton shot back with a quick smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""I trust no one else as much as I do you."" He stepped closer, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""We need to keep this quiet. If it gets out...""

Dickey leaned in across the table, matching Carlton’s intensity but with a hint of skepticism in his eyes. “You think I'm involved?” he asked pointedly.

“I don’t know who to trust anymore,” Carlton whispered back, a layer of vulnerability creeping into his voice as if peeling away the confident exterior. ""But we can figure this out together."" 

As they continued their role-play, Dickey and Carlton found themselves getting more absorbed in their characters' conflict. They improvised dialogue, creating tension, suspicion, and a complex relationship that could form the basis for an enthralling novel or screenplay. As the evening wore on, they exchanged ideas, refined their scenes, and even began to laugh at their own absurdity—two writers finding unexpected camaraderebrary in the craft of storytelling.

At the end of their session, both men sat back, exhausted but satisfied with the progress they had made. ""This is incredible,"" Dickey finally conceded, a genuine smile breaking across his face for the first time that night. “I didn’t think it could work.” 

Carlton chuckled, stretching out on one of the plush couches in Dickey's living room. ""Sometimes you just have to dive into the chaos and trust where the currents will take you,"" he said thoughtfully as they began discussing how to develop their role-play further.

From that night forward, Dickey incorporated improvisation into his writing process, finding inspiration in unexpected places—and often with Carlton by his side. They would continue meeting for these sessions, using improv to generate new and exciting storylines while honing the craft of capturing raw emotion on paper.","h z f p"
"7",7,"Malik in Wonderland",7,313,"5/23/2024","Malik had never favored dinner with “the boss.” Most of his past bosses had, at heart, been cops. His SAC at the FBI Art Theft Program had lived up to his acronym with a simmering case of Islamophobia. This despite Malik Aboud bringing a CV that included the University of St. Andrew’s, New Scotland Yard’s Art and Antiques Unit, and INTERPOL’s Stolen Works of Art Database.

But after a day in ballrooms and breakouts with panelists convinced they were solving world hunger instead of exhuming dead artists, dinner with Chairman Deshpande provided an invigorating respite. Especially at the Za’atar Palace on Randolph – a perfect compromise for the semi-observant Muslim and his Mumbai-born department chief and a virtual Moorish gallery of hand-carved furniture, sculptures, rugs, mosaics, arabesques, and chandeliers. On a Wednesday night in the Loop, the lavish dining room crackled with conversation, clatterings, and the underlying strains of the house quartet on oud, guembri, rhiata, and darbuka.

Saanvi Deshpande had been afternoon keynote for the Midwest Consortium of Art Historians and presenter of the 2024 Giorgio Vasari Award, and she attacked her fattoush with a violence Malik had considered visiting on the Za’atar’s famed lamb shanks. Instead, he’d opted for the L’ham M’hammar – Moroccan braised rabbit stew with figs and preserved lemons – after vetting the cottontail’s halal compliance.

“I didn’t realize rabbit required ritual slaughter,” Saanvi murmured as she harvested a forkful of romaine, Persian cucumber, and toasted pita redolent with mint, sumac, and pomegranate molasses.

The savory stew steamed Malik’s rimless glasses, and he waved in a cloud of tomato and ras el hanout with a beatific grin. “Yeah, the bunny’s throat and arteries are ‘humanely’ cut as the zahiba butcher invokes the name of Allah. Probably not a big hit at Easter. Guess I’m just feeling wascally. I may be heading down a rabbit hole.”

 “How so?”

“Are you familiar with the LCSNA?”

Saanvi sipped her Lavender Collins. “Another of your labyrinthine federal bureaucracies?”

“The Lewis Carroll Society of North America, dedicated to promoting awareness and appreciation of the life, times, influence, and work of the Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Chiefly, the Alice duology – Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. You may or may not know John Tenniel.”

“Illustrator of said volumes,” Saanvi supplied. “Carroll initially provided his publishers with his own drawings – the manuscript of the draft, Alice’s Adventures Underground, is on display at the British Library.” Malik shook his head in appreciation, and she smiled in kind. “My mother read both volumes to me when I was a child.”

“Dodgson’s publisher recommended he enlist Tenniel, the head caricaturist of Punch at the time – the 1860s. It was not a heaven-made match. Tenniel was an introspective man who nonetheless held rigidly to his artistic standards. Dodgson and Tenniel argued over each’s interpretation of Dodgson’s characters, and the writer actually revised his Walrus and the Carpenter poem to fit Tenniel’s conception. Tenniel also convinced Dodgson to make Alice a blonde, rather than giving her short brunette hair like Alice Liddell – Dodgson’s supposed model for the character.”

“But, ultimately, they suffered a falling out?”

“According to Warren. Warren Liddell.”

Professor Deshpande lifted her waning balloon glass as an inquisitive server hovered nearby. “Please, another? Thanks.” She turned to her colleague. “Curiouser and curiouser. Do proceed.”

**

Malik had completed his morning salat, improvising with a freshly laundered bath mat and the Qibla Compass app to direct his morning prayers, when the room phone shrilled. Assistant Professor Aboud, a transplanted Syrian-Scots-American with one loafer each in the traditional and post-9/11 worlds, glanced momentarily at his iPhone before plucking the handset from the bedside cradle.

“Professor Aboud?” The voice was British, middle-aged, and cheerfully polished. “I pray I didn’t disturb you, but I know you have a busy day ahead.”

“Not at all,” the historian murmured. “I did plan to catch a little breakfast and tea downstairs before the opening session.”

“Excellent! You shall break the fast with me.”

“We haven’t even been properly introduced.”

“Dreadfully sorry. Warren Liddell. I have a proposition you might find both academically irresistible and lucrative. I need to vet some late 19th Century sketches, and your reputation for discretion and spotting fakes is sterling.”

“Chicago has some first-class authentication services – the Winston Art Group, Art Certification Experts...”

“I’d like to keep this close to the vest, at least until I have some assurance I should proceed.”

“Proceed with what, if I may ask?”

“Proceed…to auction or a private dealer. I have a reputation, as well. If you could give me, how do they put it, a ballpark opinion, I’d be both grateful and generous. Come, what hardworking state university employee couldn’t use a free meal?”

“Few that I know.” Malik conceded.

Suite 1232 was two floors down, just beyond the ice-and-vending alcove. The door was ajar; a portly man in an unseasonably light tan suit dealt solitaire at a small dining table, flanked by a pair of plates covered with silver cloches and a matching pot.

Warren Liddell smiled up and folded the cards into a loose pile. “Can’t abide the morning talking heads and their litany of global misery and miscellany. Come. Please. Sit.”

“Unusual deck,” Malik observed, slipping into an ornately gilded chair. Liddell whipped the hood from Aboud’s shirred eggs and multi-grain toast like a Vegas magician, and poured him a cup of Earl Grey. “Sasha Dounaevski? Graphic designer from Israel, I believe?”

Liddell beamed. “Originally Belarus. The Wonderland deck – a gift from my fellow LCSNA members. The Lewis Carroll Society.”

“Whimsical, minimalist Deco touches. And the court cards -- not quite double-ended. The King of Diamonds is serving tea on one end, cake on the other. The positioning of paintbrushes and roses on the Queen of Hearts.”

“You have a marvelous eye. You know, of course, that the name ‘Malik’ means ‘king’? Another reason I felt you were the man for the job. Of course, Dounaevski’s work is a bold departure from the original drawings. How would you like to see the real thing?”

“Tenniel? You have, what, some additional sketches, rough drafts of the original Wonderland illustrations?”

“Oh, much better than that.”

“Through the Looking Glass?”

Liddell grinned silently, like Carroll’s famous feline, brushed a toast crumb from his thick mustache, and ambled to the hotel safe in the foyer closet. With an unwelcome hand on Malik’s shoulder, he placed before him a small, stained, but well-preserved vintage sketchbook. The historian turned it in his hands.

“Well, it certainly appears of the period – the 1860s or 1870s. Ah, here’s what appears to be a faded shop stamp on the inside cover. And—“ Malik froze as he carefully thumbed the heavy, browned, low-acid content pages. “I don’t seem to recognize these, ah, characters. Some sort of sphinx? A raven in a cravat? And the mirrors? I don’t recall anything like this in either of the novels. And, well, Alice herself. She doesn’t look quite the same. She looks…older? Mr. Liddell, where did you come by these sketches?”

Liddell settled back in his chair, as giddy as a Mad Hatter. “We were cousins, several degrees separated. If you know the history of Rev. Dodgson’s friendship with young Alice Liddell, you may know two of Cousin Alice’s three sons were killed during World War I, and to help pay taxes after her husband’s death a few years later, she put the original manuscript of Alice’s Adventures Underground up for auction in 1927.

“There are records of Tenniel, as well, visiting Cousin Alice, although it’s widely held the Alice of the novels wasn’t based on any specific child. My great-aunt says they got along famously despite Tenniel and Dodgson having ended their collaboration. Alice apparently decided not to auction these sketches with the Carroll manuscript. And, no disrespect intended, but…”

“Carroll was the money name, not the lowly artist,” Malik smirked. Liddell shrugged.

“And so, a few years ago, my aunt uncovered these drawings in storage. She had no idea what she had, but once I saw them, well, you can imagine.”

“I can. If, indeed, they are the real thing. But you realize I don’t have any x-ray or infrared or pigment analysis tools with me. I would have to be back on campus to be able to provide even a ‘ballpark’ authentication.”

“Of course. But you’re willing to do it?”

The eggs had congealed, the toast was cold, and the opening keynote was on in 20 minutes. “Look, I do have to go now, but I am intrigued. Will you be around later?”

Liddell practically clapped his meaty paws. “Yes, yes. I have another party who wants a peek, but I’ll be back up here by 8 tonight.”

“I have dinner with a colleague at 5, but I can cut out early on her.”

Liddell was silent for a second. “You won’t discuss any of this with her?”

“Absolutely not,” Malik lied. “Look, I’m running late.”

“For a very important date?” Liddell chuckled.

**

Malik cursed as his phone began to dance on the brocade tablecloth. His fingers were sticky from the honey-drenched baklava, and he quickly wiped them before swiping the screen and punching the speaker icon. Saanvi leaned forward.

“The tarts.” The voice was weak, strained, raspy, but undeniable. “The…tarts…”

“Mr. Liddell?” Malik demanded urgently. “Warren?”

The line went silent.

“You go,” Saanvi ordered. “I’ve got the check.” 

**

If Malik had harbored any anxieties charging into the unknown, they were allayed – or exacerbated -- by the welcoming crew waiting in Suite 1232.

A smartly appointed middle-aged woman in a smarter navy suit, who’d been staring glumly at the activity within looked up and came off the opposite corridor wall. Malik caught a glimpse of her gold nametag – Regina Sinclair/Operations Manager. “Sir, we’ve had a, an accident. You need to move on.”

“I’m the man who called you about Mr. Liddell. Malik Aboud? I had trouble getting a cab. Is he all right?”

“I would say he is not,” Sinclair answered with a somewhat accusatory tone. “The detective – Yontz, I think he said – wants to talk to you. He can fill you in on your…friend?”

A man in a suit peered around at his name, and lumbered into the hall. He gave Malik the wary up-and-down the historian had come to expect since the towers came down.

“And what is your deal?” Det. Yontz inquired.

Averting his eyes from the large man lying face down on the carpet, Malik provided an efficient synopsis, emphasizing his culinary alibi over the previous two hours and displaying his mobile call log. “Tell me – have you found a small, antique sketchbook?”

The cop called over his shoulder, collected a consensus of negative grunts. “Nope.”

Malik frowned. “Are you familiar with Alice in Wonderland?”

“Not professionally.”

“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, all on a summer day,” Malik quoted eidetically. “The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, and took them quite away!”

“If this is supposed to be a major break, I may need some clarification.”

“The cards on the desk next to Mr. Liddell’s body. When I visited this morning, he’d been playing solitaire. As apparently he had before his meeting with the killer.”

“Not sure we’ve established there even was a killer,” Yontz muttered, unconvincingly. “No sign of a struggle or any mess, though it looks like somebody may have done a fast-and-sloppy search of the place. Maybe they got in a scuffle, Liddell here has a heart attack, and his visitor tries to find whatever it was they were scuffling about. What about the cards?”

“Is there any chance I could look at them? Or you look?” Malik added hastily. “There’s a chance a card is missing.”

Yontz stared for a dead-eyed moment, then puffed his cheeks and began scanning the neatly aligned rows on the spartan hotel desk. And the single misaligned row nearest the former Carroll buff. “OK, Great Merlini, what card am I looking for?”

Malik informed him, and after a few moments, the detective glanced up with a warily respectful look. “No Queen of Hearts. You mean ‘cause of the rhyme?”

“No, that merely planted the notion in my head, though I think the one connects to the other. I think Mr. Liddell’s dying message was quite literal. Could one of your men please turn the body over?”

Another pause, then Yontz rolled his eyes at a crime scene tech and made a circular gesture. Malik winced as the inverted Liddell’s open eyes met his, then caught the thick card half-bent under the victim’s weight. Nearly identical conjoined twin queens, flanked by roses and brushes. And then he detected the small object still lodged in Liddell’s mustache.

“You might want to collect that. I believe it’s a pastry crumb, maybe part of the tart used to poison Mr. Liddell.”

“All to steal some art book? What kinda pictures were in there?”

Malik nodded. “Illustrations. One half of a whole. Mr. Liddell kept the sketchbook in his room safe, and would have brought it out to show the Queen of Hearts. That may have been the only name Mr. Liddell knew. No, this Queen was searching for something more, or at least as, important.”

“Probably got that, too.”

“Not necessarily. These collector types – especially competitive amateurs – possess a strong streak of the theatrical.”

Yontz’ crew found it, in the back of the suite’s old-school armoire, wedged behind a framed dressing mirror. Through the looking glass, Malik smiled tightly. It was little more than a rough synopsis, but no doubt crucial to both ‘Liddell’ and his killer.

“’Plot Summary: Alice, now a young woman, finds herself once again drawn into a fantastical world through an ancient, enchanted mirror hidden in the attic of her childhood home,’” Malik read through the evidence bag holding the distinctly Office Depot stock printout. “’She discovers a realm where reality bends, and the rules of logic and language are even more perplexing.’ I suspect if you examine Mr. ‘Liddell’s home computer, you’ll find the AI outline for a story meant to accompany Tenniel’s drawings. After some creative doctoring and forgery. He wouldn’t want to keep it with the sketchbook in the safe.”

“Seems like it would’ve been safer there,” Yontz quibbled.

Malik considered. “Unless,” he finally muttered, “the killer could get into the safe, as well. Can you check to see if the hotel has emergency combination override codes?”

Assistant Professor Aboud and Det. Yontz turned as one toward the now-empty corridor.

“Hey,” the investigator barked at a uniform talking Cubs with a tech. “You see Sinclair, the manager lady, leave?”

“Um,” the patrolman responded.

Another officer intervened from the bedroom. “Just got a call from Security. They got her on camera, stuck in a stalled elevator between 10 and 11. And it looks like somebody’s kicking her ass.”

**

Fortunately, Malik and Yontz were in the contingent outside the 12th Floor elevators when the car began its ascent mere seconds before the Pomeroy’s crack maintenance crew was to launch an assault. The detective and a pair of uniforms had their weapons trained as the bronze egg-and-dart-bordered doors slid open. A red-eyed Regina Sinclair glared silently from a corner of the car, nursing a split lip, and for the first time, Malik noticed the manager’s teapot earrings. A second woman emerged, gently placing a keychain canister of pepper spray on the car’s carpeted floor.

“Pardon, Malik,” Saanvi smiled. “I was on my way up; she was on her way down, rather frantically, I might add. I inquired about the incident in Suite 1232, and, well, she went quite off her head.”

“You know this nutjob?” Yontz demanded, turning to Malik.

“Careful,” Professor Deshpande admonished. “It would seem most everyone’s mad here.”

**

“I’m a bit surprised, frankly.”

Malik looked up at Saanvi’s gentle scold. The 9 a.m. Amtrak had set off on schedule, and the visiting scholars split a pooled Chicago Tribune as they rolled past factories and apartment hovels and chain-linked supply yards.

","

“You know the name Malik translates as ‘king,’ and you are fluent in five languages,” Saanvi continued. You didn’t find it at all odd that amid all this Carollian skullduggery, you were in the presence of a Regina? A queen? No doubt she arranged the fraudulent Mr. Liddell’s accommodations – ingenious, considering no one would find her roaming the hotel’s corridors noteworthy. She arrives for their rendezvous with a box of pastries from the lobby restaurant -- I consulted online, and the Pomeroy House Pub does indeed offer an Ecclefechan Butter Tart, a Scottish treat featuring dried currants. From what you described, our Alice aficionado would have relished the whimsical theatrics of tea time with a fellow enthusiast.

“And then there’s the pristine condition of Suite 1232. If we assume Ms. Sinclair doctored ‘Liddell’s tart with some form of sedative to decommission him while she searched the room, then returned to find she’d sedated him a bit too well, it would be nothing for her to procure a housekeeper’s cart, perhaps even a uniform, clean up the crumbs and any other traces of her presence, then return to her duties until ‘Liddell’s body was discovered by Housekeeping. But then Liddell came briefly around, called you, and you turned up at the scene to set the police on the correct trail.”

Malik smiled at the small thrown bone. “She needed both the authentic sketches and Liddell’s counterfeit storyline to follow through on his planned scheme. Once I’d authenticated the Tenniel sketches, they would have helped the False Mr. Liddell sell a publisher or dealer on a major literary find.”    

“I suspected chicanery from the very beginning,” Saanvi murmured, scanning her folded Tribune. “What is a six-letter word for an interconnecting network of rabbit holes? Starts with a ‘W,’ ends with an ‘N’?”

“Warren—“

Malik closed his eyes, then grinned sourly. Professor Deshpande returned to her reading.    ","“Surprised? About what?” Malik asked, folding the newspaper and setting it aside.

“That you didn’t suspect me sooner,” Saanvi replied, her eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and something darker.

Malik’s brow furrowed. “What are you talking about?”

Saanvi leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. “You see, Malik, I’ve always had a fascination with the darker side of art history. The hidden stories, the secrets buried beneath layers of paint and time. When I heard about the Tenniel sketches, I knew I had to have them.”

Malik’s heart began to race. “You mean...”

“Yes,” she interrupted, her smile widening. “I’m the Queen of Hearts. I orchestrated the entire thing. Poor Warren was just a pawn in my game. He thought he could outsmart me, but he underestimated my resolve.”

Malik’s mind raced back to the events of the past few days. The dinner, the phone call, the sketchbook. It all started to make a twisted kind of sense. “But why? Why go through all this trouble?”

Saanvi’s eyes gleamed with a manic intensity. “Because those sketches are more than just drawings. They’re a map, Malik. A map to a hidden treasure that Tenniel and Dodgson buried within their works. A treasure that could change the course of art history forever.”

Malik felt a chill run down his spine. “And you think you can find it?”

“I know I can,” she said confidently. “With your help, of course. You see, I need someone with your expertise to decode the map. And I’m willing to share the spoils.”

Malik leaned back in his seat, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts. He had a choice to make. He could turn Saanvi in and end her twisted game, or he could join her and uncover a secret that had been hidden for over a century.

As the train sped towards its destination, Malik made his decision. He leaned forward, meeting Saanvi’s gaze with a determined look. “Alright, Saanvi. Let’s see where this rabbit hole leads.”

Saanvi’s smile widened, and she extended her hand. “Welcome to Wonderland, Malik.”

As they shook hands, Malik couldn’t help but wonder if he had just made a deal with the devil. But one thing was certain: the adventure of a lifetime awaited them both.","<brainstorm>
1. **Saanvi's Hidden Agenda**: Saanvi Deshpande is not just a colleague but has a hidden agenda related to the sketches. She could be a distant relative of Alice Liddell or have a personal vendetta.
2. **The Sketchbook's True Nature**: The sketchbook contains not just illustrations but a hidden code or map leading to a treasure or another set of valuable artifacts.
3. **Regina Sinclair's Double Life**: Regina Sinclair is not just a hotel manager but an art thief with a network of accomplices. She was trying to steal the sketches for a black-market auction.
4. **Warren Liddell's Deception**: Warren Liddell faked his own death to escape with the sketches and frame someone else. The phone call was a ruse to mislead Malik.
5. **The Wonderland Connection**: The sketches are part of a larger conspiracy involving a secret society that believes in the mystical properties of Carroll's works.

Best Idea: **Saanvi's Hidden Agenda**. This twist would be the most surprising and personal, recontextualizing her actions and interactions with Malik throughout the story. It would also tie in well with the literary and historical elements of the plot.

“I’m a bit surprised, frankly,” Saanvi continued, her tone light but her eyes sharp. “You didn’t suspect me sooner.”

Malik’s brow furrowed. “Suspect you? Of what?”

Saanvi leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “Of being more than just a colleague. You see, Malik, the sketches were only part of the puzzle. The real prize was the hidden message within them.”

Malik’s mind raced. “A hidden message? But why would you—”

“Because I’m not just an art historian,” Saanvi interrupted, her smile turning cold. “I’m a descendant of Alice Liddell. The sketches were a family secret, passed down through generations. They contain a code that leads to a hidden trove of Carroll’s unpublished works and personal artifacts. My family has been searching for them for years.”

Malik’s eyes widened. “And you used me to authenticate the sketches, to make sure they were real.”

“Precisely,” Saanvi said, leaning back. “But I didn’t anticipate Warren Liddell’s interference. He was a distant relative, too, and he wanted the treasure for himself. When he realized I was onto him, he tried to cut me out. That’s why he faked his own death.”

Malik’s jaw dropped. “Faked his death? But the body—”

“Was a lookalike,” Saanvi explained. “Liddell had planned it all. The phone call, the staged scene, everything. He wanted to throw us off his trail while he made his escape with the sketches.”

Malik shook his head in disbelief. “So, where is he now?”

“On his way to England, I suspect,” Saanvi said, her eyes narrowing. “But he won’t get far. I’ve already alerted the authorities. They’ll be waiting for him at Heathrow.”

Malik exhaled, a mix of relief and astonishment washing over him. “You really thought of everything, didn’t you?”

Saanvi’s smile softened. “I had to. This is my family’s legacy. And now, thanks to you, it’s safe.”

As the train sped towards its destination, Malik couldn’t help but marvel at the twists and turns of the past few days. The mystery had been solved, but the adventure was far from over. And as he glanced at Saanvi, he realized that sometimes, the most surprising discoveries were the ones hidden in plain sight.

","“Surprised? About what?” Malik asked, folding his section of the Tribune and placing it on the small table between them.

“That you didn’t see it coming,” Saanvi replied, her eyes twinkling with a mix of amusement and reproach.

Malik raised an eyebrow. “See what coming?”

Saanvi leaned in, lowering her voice. “Regina Sinclair. The Queen of Hearts. It was all there, Malik. The teapot earrings, the obsessive attention to detail, her knowledge of the hotel’s security systems. She was practically screaming for attention.”

Malik sighed, rubbing his temples. “I suppose I was too focused on the sketches and the story. I didn’t think to look at the people around me.”

Saanvi smiled warmly. “That’s why we make a good team. You see the art, I see the people.”

Malik chuckled. “Fair enough. But there’s still one thing that bothers me.”

“What’s that?”

“The sketches. They were genuine, I’m sure of it. But why go through all this trouble for a story outline? It doesn’t add up.”

Saanvi’s smile faded, replaced by a thoughtful expression. “You’re right. There’s something more to this. Something we’re missing.”

Just then, Malik’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and saw an email notification from an unknown sender. He opened it, his eyes widening as he read the message.

“What is it?” Saanvi asked, leaning closer.

Malik handed her the phone. “Read for yourself.”

Saanvi took the phone and read the email aloud. “‘Dear Professor Aboud, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that the sketches you examined are indeed genuine. However, they are not merely illustrations. They are part of a larger puzzle, a map, if you will, leading to a hidden treasure. The story outline was a decoy, meant to distract from the true prize. I trust you will know what to do with this information. Sincerely, A Friend.’”

Saanvi looked up, her eyes wide with excitement. “A hidden treasure? This just got a lot more interesting.”

Malik nodded, a determined look on his face. “Indeed it did. We need to get back to Chicago and find out what this treasure is. And who this ‘Friend’ might be.”

Saanvi grinned. “Looks like our adventure is just beginning.”

As the train sped towards its destination, Malik and Saanvi began to piece together the clues, their minds racing with possibilities. The sketches, the story, the hidden treasure – it was all connected, and they were determined to uncover the truth.

Little did they know, the real mystery was far more intricate and dangerous than they could have ever imagined. And the true mastermind behind it all was someone they would never suspect."," As Aboud and Malik sat in one of the observation cars, gazing out at the passing landscape, their conversation was interrupted by Yontz's approach. He had just received word that Regina Sinclair, the hotel manager, was caught on camera being assaulted in an elevator between 10 and 11 a.m., while another woman emerged from the stalled car with pepper spray.

“Well, well,” Malik said to Saanvi, “looks like our theory about Mr. Liddell's death may be more complex than we thought.”

Aboud nodded in agreement as they both watched Yontz approach them.

""Yeonzoff,"" Yontz called out, ""we have a situation.""

Malik and Aboud turned to face the detective, their curiosity piqued.

“Our dear hotel manager, Regina Sinclair,” Yontz began, “she's been involved in an altercation with some unknown assailant in the elevator between 10 and 11 a.m. The other woman who came out of the car is claiming self-defense.”

Malik raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the unexpected turn of events. “Well, that does throw a wrench into our investigation,” he remarked.

Aboud chimed in, “It seems we have more than just one mystery to solve now. The connection between Mr. Liddell's death and this altercation could be crucial.”

Yontz nodded grimly. ""Indeed,"" he said. ""We need to find out what really happened in that elevator.""

As they continued their conversation, the train rumbled along the tracks, carrying them further away from the hotel but not far enough from the case at hand. They knew that unraveling this web of deceit would require all their skills and resources. But for now, as long as they were within reach of a phone signal or Wi-Fi hotspot, they could start piecing together the clues that lay scattered across Chicago's sprawling cityscape.

“We should head back to the hotel,"" Aboud suggested. ""The sooner we gather more information about this new incident, the better.""

Malik agreed wholeheartedly. He knew that time was of the essence; every minute spent on this train only widened the gap between them and their next breakthrough in this case. They exchanged a quick farewell with the departing Amtrak scholars before stepping off at Union Station, ready to delve deeper into the intrigue surrounding Regina Sinclair's mysterious altercation on that fateful morning.","z f p h"
"8",8,"Mystery at Milhouse Mansion",8,213,"5/12/2024","Milhouse Mansion had all the makings of a horror story brought to life. Built of all brick without a welcoming porch to keep its visitors dry, it was surrounded by an old, rusty wrought iron fence whose gate creaked like a banshee’s shriek. Winter bare trees with branches like an old lady’s fingers reaching out from some child’s nightmare swayed in the icy wind. Sleet pelted down on my hat and trench coat as lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. Normally I would not venture out on such a night, but I received a phone call from Mrs. Elanore Milhouse stating that my services were required at once.

Upon arriving, the lady of the manor was eagerly awaiting my arrival and hurried me out of the horrendous weather. She personally took my hat and coat, the butler being excused from his services due to the secrecy of our meeting, and she guided me to her husband’s library. Her husband, Senator Ronald Milhouse, was busy entertaining his guests for the dinner he was hosting to raise money for his re-election campaign. A conversation had been overheard that there was to be an attempt on the senator’s life, an assassination. Mrs. Milhouse remembered my name, Inspector Delmore Calloway, from recent news headlines concerning a jewel heist I solved, greeting me with the statement that my reputation preceded me.

My first concern was whether or not the senator was made aware of his life being in peril. According to his lovely wife, he found it preposterous that men of such outstanding reputation would dare tarnish their good names and family legacies with foul play. Yet, Mrs. Milhouse’s concern warranted investigation concerning her husband’s position in the political arena, where enemies are made daily, and friendships are circumstantial.

I questioned Mrs. Milhouse about her husband’s guest list. The name that stood out the most to me was William Grant, a man who had made his millions in steel. Senator Milhouse is a staunch supporter of unionization and ending child labor. That would have a major impact on Grant’s production. Next were Allen Greenburgh, who made his money from oil, Tobben Wainwright, railroads, and Harvy Bitterman, cattle. To expand business, those men needed land. Senator Milhouse was trying to push a bill to add more federally protected lands to the register. It was a long shot, but one or more of those men might have been hard pressed for some of the acreage the senator was pushing to protect. Junior Senator Jefferson Westmore would have seen his influence increase two-fold if the senior senator were to come to an untimely end, but not so much as to warrant murder in my opinion. Then there was James Morgan, a banker. I saw no connection whatsoever, other than the senator’s support for women’s right to vote. Something that might have upset all of them.

My expertise was in solving crimes after they occurred. I used deductive reasoning, analyzing evidence and motives. I was not confident those men had motive and without evidence there would have been only denial to any accusation. I lit my pipe and pondered the situation, leaning on the mantle where Mrs. Milhouse had built a fire for me to warm myself. We may not have a concrete motive or any evidence, but we do have a witness in Mrs. Milhouse herself. I asked her if she would be able to recall the voice upon hearing it again. She said it was not her who heard it, but her children.

I dare say that I was not amused in the least that accusations were being made against the most powerful men in the state based on hearsay of children. My reputation could be irreparably tarnished. Mrs. Milhouse insisted that the children were terribly upset, and that the situation needed to be treated with the utmost seriousness given her husband’s status on capitol hill. I requested to speak with the children immediately.

While Mrs. Milhouse fetched the children, I turned my attention to the window. The storm had moved on, and the sleet had turned to snow, blanketing the landscape outside. If someone were to murder the senator, it would have had to have been by poison, otherwise they would have required a speedy departure, which would have been nearly impossible on a night like that. And the senator was right, soiling their reputations was not in those men’s best interest. There was nothing to gain for men who had everything. We probably should have been looking at the staff as possible suspects.

Mrs. Milhouse returned with two young children at her heals. I knelt down and asked them in a soothing voice their names and ages: Martha, 8, and Charles 6. We moved to sit, since my knees were no longer what they were. The young ones took the sofa, their little feet dangling in the air. Mrs. Milhouse and I took the oversized leather lounge chairs by the fire. I was offered a cognac, which I delightfully accepted. I smoked and drank, enjoying the warmth of the fire as the children relayed the events of earlier that evening. They had been playing hide-&-seek as the guests arrived. Young Charles was hiding in the closet with a coat over his head when a man was hanging up his coat. The man said to someone else, “It does not matter how much money he raises. He is not suitable for the position of senator. We are going to kill him, so just play your part.”

That was definitely concerning. I asked Charles if he would recognize the voice if he heard it again. The boy shrugged. I sat silently for a moment deep in thought. I asked him if it sounded like any of the house servants. He responded with an, ""I don't think so."" An idea came to mind. I asked Mrs. Milhouse if she would be willing to take the children to the parlor to say goodnight to everyone before dinner commences. I told Charles to listen closely to everyone’s voices. If he recognized a voice, he was to tell his mother who was to tell me.

 Mrs. Milhouse and her children were gone for quite some time. I relaxed with ease between the soft chair, warm fire, and soothing drink. I had just closed my eyes when Mrs. Milhouse returned with her children. She told me that Charles identified Howard Marcus as the voice he heard. I had to question who Howard Marcus was, not being on the guest list or a name I was familiar with. It turned out he was the senator’s campaign manager. An odd role for a murder suspect. If he felt the senator was not capable of the position, why not vacate his own position. None the less, I asked Mrs. Milhouse to excuse the children and we went to find Mr. Marcus.

Mr. Marcus, who insisted I call him Howard, was cordial and cooperative when I introduced myself and informed him that I required his presence in private to discuss urgent matters. When I brought to his attention that there was a conspiracy to assassinate the senator tonight, he looked legitimately surprised and concerned. When I told him that we have a witness hearing him doing the conspiring, he was shocked and demanded to know what the witness heard because he had made no such statements regarding the senator’s life. When I repeated what was said to me, he relaxed and laughed saying, “I did say something like that. I was talking to James Morgan about Tobben Wallace, the senator’s opposition. I meant we are going to kill him at the poles.”

We all relaxed and had a hearty laugh. It was just the misunderstanding of children at play. Howard was very understanding and felt Mrs. Milhouse took the right precautions by requesting my services. Mrs. Milhouse said she would triple my rate for the inconvenience of time, weather, and relevancy. She also invited me to stay for dinner. An invitation I couldn’t refuse.

","

At dinner, Mrs. Milhouse made my introduction, explaining my reason for being there. Everyone had a good laugh, but said she was wise for being prudent. Most of the dinner guests had heard of me, and welcomed me kindly, enthralled by my stories of mystery and mayhem. It was in the middle of one of my stories that the senator began coughing. Nothing serious at first, but it began to worsen. Then his airway became obstructed. He was struggling to breathe. I checked his mouth, assuming he was choking, but saw nothing. I feared the worst and took a whiff of his wine glass. Poison. Served to him by the butler. I hurried into the kitchen. It was empty. I heard a car and ran to the back door just in time to see the butler drive off with Mr. Marcus.

I made the mistake of taking an adults word over a child's. Mr. Marcus had lied to us. His motive is still unclear, but it appears he was the mastermind behind the assassination. I also overlooked one tiny detail. The butler always answers the door and takes the caller's coat. I went against my instincts when I thought the staff might be involved. Someday I will learn. It is always the butler.","As the evening progressed, the tension in the air dissipated, replaced by the clinking of glasses and the hum of polite conversation. The senator, unaware of the earlier commotion, was in high spirits, mingling with his guests and making his case for re-election. I found myself seated next to Mrs. Milhouse, who seemed relieved that the threat had been a mere misunderstanding.

Dinner was a lavish affair, with courses that seemed to never end. I was halfway through a particularly succulent roast when I noticed something peculiar. Mrs. Milhouse, who had been the epitome of grace and composure, was now fidgeting with her napkin, her eyes darting nervously around the room. I followed her gaze and saw that it was fixed on Howard Marcus, who was engaged in a heated discussion with James Morgan.

A sudden realization struck me. The children had overheard Howard Marcus, but what if there was more to the story? What if the real threat was still lurking, hidden beneath layers of deception?

I excused myself from the table and made my way to the library, where I could think in solitude. The fire had died down, casting long shadows across the room. I replayed the events of the evening in my mind, searching for any detail I might have missed. And then it hit me—the children. They had been playing hide-and-seek, but what if they had overheard more than just a single conversation?

I rushed back to the dining room, my heart pounding. I found Mrs. Milhouse and whispered urgently in her ear. She paled but nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. We needed to speak to the children again, immediately.

In the privacy of the library, I asked Charles and Martha to recount everything they had heard that evening. Charles hesitated, then said, ""There was another man, after Mr. Marcus. He said something about 'ensuring the senator's silence.'""

My blood ran cold. This was no misunderstanding. I asked Charles if he could identify the voice, and he nodded. ""It was the man with the funny mustache,"" he said.

I knew instantly who he meant—James Morgan, the banker. But why would a banker want the senator dead? The pieces fell into place. Morgan had no direct motive, but he was deeply in debt to Tobben Wainwright, the railroad magnate. Wainwright needed the senator out of the way to expand his business, and Morgan was his pawn.

I alerted Mrs. Milhouse, and we discreetly informed the senator. Security was tightened, and Morgan was quietly escorted out of the mansion. The evening continued without further incident, but the true danger had been averted.

As I left Milhouse Mansion, the snow crunching under my feet, I couldn't help but marvel at the layers of deception and the innocence of children that had ultimately saved the day. The storm had passed, but the memory of that night would linger, a testament to the unexpected twists that life—and mystery—can bring.","<brainstorm>
1. **The Butler Did It**: The butler, who was excused from his duties, was actually plotting the assassination. He overheard the children and manipulated the situation to frame Howard Marcus.
2. **Mrs. Milhouse's Secret**: Mrs. Milhouse herself is behind the plot. She wants to inherit her husband's wealth and power. She used the children to create a diversion.
3. **The Children’s Game**: The children were not playing hide-and-seek but were actually spying on the guests as part of a game orchestrated by someone else.
4. **The Real Target**: The real target was not the senator but someone else at the party, and the overheard conversation was a red herring.
5. **The Campaign Manager’s Double Game**: Howard Marcus is playing a double game, pretending to be loyal while actually plotting against the senator for personal gain.

Best Idea: **Mrs. Milhouse's Secret**. This twist would be the most surprising and would recontextualize her actions throughout the story. It would also explain why she was so insistent on the urgency and secrecy of the meeting.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
As we settled back into the library, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. Mrs. Milhouse's insistence on secrecy, her urgency, and the children's involvement all seemed too convenient. I decided to probe a bit further.

""Mrs. Milhouse,"" I began, ""you mentioned that your husband found the idea of an assassination preposterous. Yet, you seemed quite certain. Why is that?""

She hesitated, her eyes flickering to the fire. ""A wife knows when her husband is in danger, Inspector.""

""Indeed,"" I said, leaning forward. ""But a wife also knows her husband's habits and routines. Tell me, how did you come to suspect Howard Marcus?""

She looked taken aback. ""The children—""

""Yes, the children,"" I interrupted. ""Children who were conveniently playing hide-and-seek in a closet at the exact moment a damning conversation took place. Children who, despite their young age, were able to identify a voice they had only heard briefly.""

Her face paled. ""What are you implying, Inspector?""

""I'm implying that this entire scenario was orchestrated,"" I said, standing up. ""You needed a scapegoat, and Howard Marcus was the perfect candidate. But why, Mrs. Milhouse? Why go to such lengths?""

She stood up as well, her composure cracking. ""You don't understand. Ronald is a fool. His idealism is ruining us. The bills he's pushing will destroy our wealth, our influence. I couldn't let that happen.""

""So you planned to have him killed and frame Howard Marcus,"" I concluded. ""But why involve the children?""

""They were a necessary part of the plan,"" she said coldly. ""No one would suspect a mother using her own children.""

I nodded, understanding now. ""But you underestimated one thing, Mrs. Milhouse. The truth has a way of coming out.""

At that moment, the door burst open, and two police officers entered, having been summoned by a discreet signal I had sent earlier. Mrs. Milhouse's face twisted in rage as they took her into custody.

As she was led away, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness for the children, who had been pawns in a dangerous game. But justice had been served, and the senator's life was no longer in peril.

I declined the invitation to dinner, feeling the weight of the evening's revelations. As I stepped out into the snowy night, I couldn't help but think that sometimes, the greatest mysteries lie not in the actions of strangers, but in the hearts of those closest to us.

","As the evening progressed, the tension in the air dissipated, replaced by the clinking of glasses and the hum of polite conversation. The senator’s guests were in high spirits, and the dinner was a grand affair. I found myself seated next to Mrs. Milhouse, who was the epitome of grace and charm, her earlier anxiety seemingly forgotten.

The meal was exquisite, and the wine flowed freely. I engaged in light conversation with the other guests, my earlier suspicions now a distant memory. Howard Marcus, the campaign manager, was particularly jovial, regaling us with tales of past political campaigns and the eccentricities of various politicians.

As dessert was being served, a sudden commotion erupted at the far end of the table. Senator Milhouse clutched his chest, his face contorted in pain. He gasped for breath, his eyes wide with terror. The room fell silent, and then chaos ensued. Guests leapt to their feet, shouting for help. Mrs. Milhouse screamed, her face a mask of horror.

I rushed to the senator’s side, my mind racing. This was no mere heart attack; the senator had been poisoned. But how? The food and drink had been shared by all. I scanned the room, my eyes landing on Howard Marcus, who was standing frozen, his face pale.

“Call an ambulance!” I shouted, but I knew it would be too late. The senator’s breathing was shallow, his pulse weak. He was slipping away before our eyes.

In the midst of the chaos, a thought struck me. The cognac. I had been offered a glass earlier, but the senator had declined, preferring his usual brandy. I turned to Mrs. Milhouse, who was now sobbing uncontrollably.

“Who poured the senator’s drink?” I demanded.

She looked up, her eyes red and swollen. “Howard did. He always does.”

I turned to Howard, who was now backing away, his hands raised in a gesture of innocence. “I didn’t do anything! I swear!”

But it was too late. The senator’s body went limp, and he was gone.

The room fell into a stunned silence. I stood up, my mind racing. Howard had been the one to pour the senator’s drink, but he had seemed genuinely shocked when I confronted him earlier. Could it have been an act?

I approached Howard, my voice low and menacing. “You said you were talking about killing Tobben Wallace at the polls. But what if you were lying? What if you were planning this all along?”

Howard shook his head vehemently. “No, you have to believe me! I would never—”

Before he could finish, a voice cut through the tension. “He’s telling the truth.”

I turned to see James Morgan, the banker, standing at the doorway. His face was calm, almost serene. “Howard didn’t poison the senator. I did.”

The room erupted in gasps. Mrs. Milhouse looked at Morgan, her eyes wide with disbelief. “But why?”

Morgan smiled, a cold, calculating smile. “Because the senator was a threat to all of us. His policies would have ruined us. We couldn’t let that happen.”

I stepped forward, my hand reaching for my revolver. “You’re under arrest, Morgan.”

But before I could draw my weapon, Morgan pulled out a small vial from his pocket and swallowed its contents. He collapsed to the floor, convulsing.

I knelt beside him, but it was too late. The poison had done its work. Morgan’s eyes glazed over, and he was gone.

The room was silent once more, the weight of the evening’s events settling over us like a shroud. Mrs. Milhouse collapsed into a chair, her body wracked with sobs. The guests stood in stunned silence, the reality of the situation sinking in.

As I looked around the room, I realized that the senator’s death had been more than just a political assassination. It was a stark reminder of the lengths to which people would go to protect their interests. And in the end, it was the children’s innocent game of hide-and-seek that had uncovered the dark truth lurking within Milhouse Mansion."," The next day, Inspector Delmore Calloway found himself back at Milhouse Mansion as a guest rather than an investigator. Over dinner that evening, he chatted with Mrs. Milhouse about her children's vivid imagination and the misunderstanding of their playful words the previous night.

As dessert was being served, a sudden commotion arose from outside; it seemed like another storm had hit overnight. The lights flickered before completely shutting down. Everyone in the room froze for a moment until Mrs. Milhouse quickly lit candles around the dining table casting dancing shadows on their faces.

Just as they were recovering from the surprise, a loud knock echoed through the mansion. It was Howard Marcus - the campaign manager whom Calloway had questioned the previous night. His face was pale; he stammered out some words before collapsing into a chair at the table. He claimed that there had been an attempt on his life by Tobben Wallace, the senator's opposition!

Marcus explained how he had received threatening letters for weeks now but never took them seriously until now - when he found himself cornered in his own campaign office with a knife plunged into his shoulder. The shock was palpable as Calloway realized that the threat was real, and they'd been sitting on it all night!

Calloway quickly acted; using his wit and years of experience, he managed to keep everyone calm while dialing for an ambulance. He then questioned Marcus further about the threats in a desperate attempt to understand who might be behind this sinister game. In the midst of chaos, Calloway found himself at the heart of another investigation, and his dinner invitation had turned into something far more serious than he'd anticipated.","h z p f"
"9",9,"gone",9,86,"4/5/2024","The photo trembled in my shaking hands. My memory was foggy and distant with grief. I must have taken the photo because I was not in it. I strained my memory to remember the last moments of that day as I stood with camera in hand looking at my friends who stood with the lake at their backs. The fog began to dissipate. It was moments later, I hugged my friends, climbed into the car with my parents and put the horrific summer in the rearview mirror. I brought the photo to my face and that is when I saw it. I did not want to believe my eyes. This changed everything. Everything.

##

I stand with my hand on the handle of the closet working up my gumption to dive in. I call this closet The Abyss. The abyss is a living journal of my life, and it swallows the parts of my past that I’m not prepared to face in any given moment. But I am running out of time, and it must be faced today. The U-haul is coming on Friday.

My living room is a Stonehenge of packed boxes that are starting to leak into the hallway like cardboard mold. On Saturday, a battalion of friends and neighbors, I begged to help me, are coming to load all my possessions into the truck and I absolutely refuse not to be ready for their arrival. I will not be the friend who asked her friends to help her move and when they arrive, I will surprise them with the fact that they have been enlisted to help pack my crap and then move it!

The abyss is full of boxes I never unpacked from the last move. An abandoned chair. A spare television. A dust covered camera. Craft stuff from my creative phase. Canvases and oils from my painting phase. A cello from my musical phase. Three-ring binders full of college papers and textbooks that couldn’t be sold back to the bookstore. Boxes of childhood photos, plaster handprints, watercolor paintings that long ago fell from the fridge museum, and dried flowers from high-school dances with awkward boys. And about four hundred and fifty-six VHS videos from Disney classics in the thick white plastic holders to tv series collections of House, Parks and Rec and Gilmore Girls.

I purposely left this closet for last.

I am already eating on paper plates because I packed my dishes last week. My beloved books were carefully packed in boxes and labeled by genre (small boxes so no one throws their back out). I am showering with a travel bag because there is nothing left on my bathroom shelves except dust and a nail polish stain. I am fully ready to move except for the abyss.

I knew I was going to need time for this closet. This is going to be a battle. A struggle to decide what items I will move again and what items I need to leave behind for good. I’ve never been good at saying goodbye. I’ve already done it more than one person should have to in a lifetime.

The apartment waiting for me a thousand miles from here cannot hold everything. This is meant to be my starting over. The divorce is final. My mom is gone. And my dad is not speaking to me.

I start with the easy stuff. The spare tv can be donated; the random chair can go with the tv; and I can put my painting phase behind me. I promised myself that if the craft items and the glue gun were essential to life in the next city, I will buy them again. I am certain I haven’t been in a Hobby Lobby for a decade.

The VHS. My VHS player gasped out its last video-eating breath last month in the middle of PS I Love You. It must have been all the romantic comedies I played while finalizing the end of my marriage to He Who Must Not Be Named. They could go. Right? Yes. Of course. I don’t even have a way to watch them. Each boxy movie has a memory…not the actual tape. Most of them are on Netflix. It is time to for them to go. I take a few last photos and box them up.

Technology has moved on. So can I.

Then it gets a little harder. I never play the cello anymore, but I can still picture the last night I played for my mom. Just before the end when she was only awake a few hours a day. Maybe if I donated it, it could be someone else’s first cello. I put it in the donate pile but give myself the freedom to veto three items. I allow myself three items to be reversed from the donation pile. So, I put it off to one side just in case.

I turn some music on my phone and look wide-eyed at the stack of photo boxes. The key to photo boxes is to send them on to the next location without looking inside because if you open Pandora’s box of photos, you will be swimming in that pool all night. The stack teeters as I pull it from the top shelf, boxes stacked precariously clear to the ceiling totter and tumble sending photo boxes all over the floor.

Photos are raining down on me and my quick-bun hair to a scattered mess covering my bare feet. And suddenly I am diving headfirst into the memory pool. I clear a space, sit on the floor, and start to sort the photos.

Hours pass without notice as I take a moment, sometimes longer, with each photo. The images they conjure are so dense that I can breathe them in like the scent of dusty volumes of my life opening with the fluttering pages of a book.

I freeze. The next image on the top of the stack is Kate. Oh Kate. I am suddenly standing on the edge of Lost Lake as a fifteen-year-old. A cool breeze is coming off the water and Kate’s hand is wrapped around mine. I look down at our grasping hands and see Kate’s favorite thing in the world – the black braided leather bracelet her father had given her from Africa. Kate and I have met at Lost Lake with our families every summer since we were five. And we have neighboring cabins for three weeks each July.

I was always jealous of Kate with her waist-length, jet-black hair, and deep golden-brown eyes. She is unexpected and sarcastic. She is the youngest of five children. and every year, one of her siblings went away to college or gets married. This year, Kate was the only one who had come to the lake with her parents. Kate has a secret crush on one of the other campers who comes each year. Other families were regulars at the lake: the Walkers, the Drakes and the Nielsens. Erica Walker, Ransom Drake, and Peter Nielsen were our age. Kate was falling for Peter, but she refused to tell him. She didn’t want their friendship to become more and just be a “summer thing.”

Kate and I would ride our bikes around the lake until it got dark, and our mothers were shouting for us to come in for dinner. I brought my new camera and was shooting the lake, the cabins, the woods, my friends, and the fire. I waited all year for summer break with my best friend. After dinner, all of us would build a fire in the pit at the bowery and tell scary stories all night long while wrapped in blankets and roasting marshmallows.

That summer things were different. Ransom had noticed that things had changed with Kate, and he was not happy about it. Ransom had been in love with Kate since the first summer they had met at the lake. But Kate had never felt the same about Ransom. They were good friends but to Kate they were nothing else.

As I’m picking up the other photos from that summer at the cabin, the image in my mind changes and I am standing at the lake alone. The lights from the police cars and ambulances are reflecting off the lake and swirling in red and blue circles as the sun sets. The wail of the fire engines is deafening. My blanket drops at my feet. The goosebumps on my arms are raising the tiny hairs. The chill is setting in, but I can’t move to get the blanket at my feet. If Kate is somewhere cold, I should be cold too. The adults are hovering together in bundles and the police officers are taking notes on tiny note pads.

Kate’s parents are crying. People are emerging from the woods with flashlights calling Kate’s name.

When we returned from grocery shopping in the city with my parents, an officer met us at the front door. Had we seen Kate? We had been swimming that morning and shared breakfast on the deck. Ransom and Erica had ridden past on their bikes as we finished our bacon and eggs. I left Kate at her front door with the promise to meet up when we got back from the city. My mother insisted I go with them. That was the last time I saw her. I could picture her plaited sun dress, her hair pulled back in a long ponytail and her brown sandals.

Kate’s parents, Renee and Kyle Leigh, told the police that Kate had decided to try and catch up with Erica and Ransom. She left on her bike. And never came back.

Her bike was discovered on the other side of the lake but there was no sign of Kate. Erica and Ransom said they had not seen her even though they were on the trail on their bikes. Peter’s family had taken the ATV’s to Beckstead Hill and had also been gone all day. We stood together for hours waiting for information. They would not let us go far on the island because it was now a crime scene. I slid from inconsolable to emotionally comatose. What could have happened to her?

There were only two other cabins in the area. The Whittaker Family was in the cabin on the other side of Leigh’s cabin. The last cabin on the loop was rented that entire summer by a writer, Phil Bennington. Phil did not leave the cabin often. He only emerged to have a cigarette on the porch at random intervals. The police lights brought him to his window, but he escaped back into the darkness quickly. I imagine he didn’t want anything to do with the trouble.

Even now, sixteen years later, the ache brings a lump to my throat. And I wonder if Kate died quickly or suffered.

Under the picture of Kate on the photo pile, I pick up a paper-clipped stack of faded newspaper articles about Kate’s disappearance. It describes how they had all gone out looking and calling her name. They had divers searching the lake to see if they could find her body. I remember shouting her name as we combed the island until I could no longer speak.

The police focused their investigation first on Kate’s parents and then the recluse writer Phil. As the days faded, the leads faded. Everyone was cleared and invited to go home. My mom was worried about taking me home. I felt like I had to be the one to find her. There had to be a clue. How could she have vanished without a trace? I had been with her just hours before. Kate, where are you?

I took a few last photos before I left the island. Suddenly I felt like I should document everything. What if I never saw Erica, Ransom or Peter again?

We all were forced to live our lives without her. Like a life without the sun.

My family returned to the island one more year. I was still looking for Kate even though I knew she would not be there. The Leigh family would not, maybe could not, come back. It was beyond them. Erica and her family came back; Ransom’s family returned but he did not come with them. Peter’s family made their excuses, but they would not be back to the Lake.

##

I hadn’t looked through these pictures in years. When we returned from the island, I couldn’t bear to look at the photos I had taken that entire summer. I put them in this box and never looked back. In the sea of photos, I found those last few images from my last day on the island. There was one of my three friends standing in front of the lake with arms around one another. They look drawn, spent and under slept. Their eyes red rimmed with tears as we held on to each other with a new intensity.

Something caught my eye. I held the picture closer to my face in disbelief.

","

There is no way this could be. What did this mean? Could they have had something to do with Kate’s disappearance? Had they seen her on the biking trail that day? Had she come upon something she wasn’t meant to see?

What do I do with this information over a decade later? I need to take this to the police. And tell the Leigh family.

I would recognize it anywhere. Kate was never without it.

There on Ransom’s wrist. A black braided leather bracelet from Africa. ","There, in the background of the photo, partially obscured by the trees, was a figure. A figure I had never noticed before. My heart pounded as I squinted, trying to make out the details. The figure was wearing a dark hoodie, the face hidden in the shadows. But it was the bracelet that caught my attention—the black braided leather bracelet that Kate's father had given her from Africa.

I dropped the photo, my hands trembling. How could this be? Kate had been missing for sixteen years. I picked up the photo again, my mind racing. The figure was standing near the edge of the lake, almost blending into the background. It was as if Kate had been there, watching us, the entire time.

I scrambled through the other photos, looking for more clues. There, in another photo taken earlier that day, was the same figure, this time closer to the group, almost as if she was trying to join us but couldn't. My breath caught in my throat. Could it be that Kate had never left the island? That she had been hiding all these years?

I remembered the reclusive writer, Phil Bennington. He had always seemed odd, but harmless. What if he had something to do with Kate's disappearance? What if he had been keeping her hidden all these years? My mind raced with possibilities.

I grabbed my phone and dialed the number of the local police department near Lost Lake. My voice shook as I explained what I had found. The officer on the other end listened intently, promising to reopen the case and investigate further.

As I hung up, I felt a strange mix of hope and dread. If Kate was still alive, what kind of life had she been living? And why had she never tried to contact us? The answers were out there, waiting to be uncovered. And this time, I wouldn't stop until I found them.","<brainstorm>
1. The photo reveals a shadowy figure in the background, someone who shouldn't have been there. This person could be the key to Kate's disappearance.
2. The photo shows Kate wearing something that she didn't have when she disappeared, suggesting she met someone after the protagonist last saw her.
3. The photo reveals a hidden message or clue that Kate left behind, indicating she knew she was in danger.
4. The protagonist realizes that one of their friends, who seemed innocent, was actually involved in Kate's disappearance.
5. The photo shows a reflection in the lake that reveals a hidden location or person.

Best Idea: The photo reveals a shadowy figure in the background, someone who shouldn't have been there. This person could be the key to Kate's disappearance. This twist will recontextualize the earlier events and provide a satisfying resolution by identifying the person responsible for Kate's disappearance.

I held the picture closer to my face in disbelief. There, in the background, partially obscured by the trees, was a shadowy figure. My heart raced as I tried to make out the details. The figure was standing near the edge of the lake, watching us. It was Phil Bennington, the reclusive writer.

I remembered how he had stayed hidden in his cabin, only emerging for a cigarette. But why was he lurking in the background of our photo? My mind raced back to that summer, piecing together fragments of memories. Phil had always been an enigma, a man who kept to himself, but now I wondered if he had been hiding something more sinister.

I quickly grabbed my laptop and searched for any recent news about Phil Bennington. My heart pounded as I found an article about his recent arrest for a series of crimes in another state. The article mentioned that he had been under investigation for years, suspected of preying on young girls.

I felt a chill run down my spine. Could it be that Phil had been watching us all along, waiting for the right moment to strike? I called the police and shared my discovery, urging them to reopen Kate's case and investigate Phil Bennington further.

Days later, I received a call from the detective handling the case. They had found new evidence linking Phil to Kate's disappearance. A search of his old cabin revealed a hidden compartment with personal items belonging to Kate, including her beloved black braided leather bracelet.

The truth was finally uncovered. Phil Bennington had been the one who took Kate that fateful day. The police were able to piece together the events, and Phil was charged with her abduction and murder.

As I packed the last of my belongings, I felt a sense of closure. Kate's disappearance had haunted me for years, but now I knew the truth. I placed the photo back in the box, knowing that while the memories of that summer would always be bittersweet, I could finally move forward.

The U-haul arrived, and with it, a new beginning. I took one last look at the apartment, closed the door, and stepped into the future, leaving the past behind.

I felt a chill run down my spine. Could it be that Phil had been watching us all along, waiting for the right moment to strike? I called the police and shared my discovery, urging them to reopen Kate's case and investigate Phil Bennington further.

Days later, I received a call from the detective handling the case. They had found new evidence linking Phil to Kate's disappearance. A search of his old cabin revealed a hidden compartment with personal items belonging to Kate, including her beloved black braided leather bracelet.

The truth was finally uncovered. Phil Bennington had been the one who took Kate that fateful day. The police were able to piece together the events, and Phil was charged with her abduction and murder.

As I packed the last of my belongings, I felt a sense of closure. Kate's disappearance had haunted me for years, but now I knew the truth. I placed the photo back in the box, knowing that while the memories of that summer would always be bittersweet, I could finally move forward.

The U-haul arrived, and with it, a new beginning. I took one last look at the apartment, closed the door, and stepped into the future, leaving the past behind.
","There, in the background of the photo, partially obscured by the trees, was a figure. A figure I had never noticed before. My heart pounded as I squinted, trying to make out the details. The figure was wearing a dark hoodie, the face hidden in the shadows. But it was the bracelet that caught my attention—the black braided leather bracelet that Kate's father had given her from Africa. The same bracelet Kate never took off.

I felt a chill run down my spine. How could this be? Kate had disappeared that day, and yet here she was, in the background of a photo taken after she was supposed to be gone. My mind raced with possibilities. Had she been hiding all along? Was she taken and somehow managed to escape, only to be lurking in the shadows?

I needed answers. I grabbed my phone and dialed Erica's number. She picked up on the third ring.

""Hey, it's me,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I found something. A photo from that summer. There's someone in the background, and I think it might be Kate.""

There was a long pause on the other end. ""Are you sure?"" Erica finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

""I don't know,"" I admitted. ""But I need to find out.""

We agreed to meet at a café near Erica's place. I packed the photo carefully and headed out, my mind a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. When I arrived, Erica was already there, her face pale and anxious. I handed her the photo, and she stared at it for a long time.

""That's her bracelet,"" she said, her voice cracking. ""But how...?""

We decided to visit the island one last time. We needed to see if there were any clues we had missed. The next morning, we drove to Lost Lake, the place that had haunted our memories for so long. The cabins were still there, though they looked more weathered and abandoned.

We retraced our steps from that fateful day, following the path Kate would have taken. As we reached the spot where her bike had been found, something caught my eye—a small, weathered notebook half-buried in the dirt. I picked it up and opened it, my hands shaking.

Inside were pages filled with Kate's handwriting. She had been keeping a journal, documenting her days in hiding. She wrote about how she had discovered something she wasn't supposed to see—Phil Bennington, the reclusive writer, had been involved in something sinister. She had planned to confront him but had been forced to hide when she realized the danger she was in.

The last entry was dated the day she disappeared. She wrote about how she had seen Phil meeting with someone in the woods, exchanging a package. She had taken a photo with her own camera, hoping it would be enough to expose him. But she had been spotted, and she knew she had to run.

Erica and I exchanged horrified glances. We had to find that camera. We rushed to the old cabin where Phil had stayed, now abandoned and overgrown. Inside, we found a hidden compartment under the floorboards. There it was—Kate's camera, still intact.

We developed the film and found the photo Kate had taken. It showed Phil handing a package to a man we recognized from the news—he was a wanted criminal. The evidence was undeniable.

We took the photo to the police, and an investigation was reopened. Phil Bennington was arrested, and the truth about Kate's disappearance finally came to light. She had been hiding all these years, too afraid to come forward. But now, with the evidence we had found, she could finally be free.

As I stood by the lake one last time, I felt a sense of closure. Kate's disappearance had changed everything, but now, at least, we had some answers. And maybe, just maybe, we could all start to heal."," As you immerse yourself in the memories of Kate's last summer at Lost Lake, the weight of unresolved emotions and questions presses upon you. You find solace in sorting through the photos, each one a portal into a moment frozen in time.

You are transported back to that fateful night when you stood on the edge of Lost Lake with Kate by your side. The black braided leather bracelet her father had given her from Africa adorns her wrist, and it is clear she holds this treasure close to her heart. Together, you've spent summers at Lost Lake since childhood, building cherished memories amidst the tranquil surroundings of Leigh's cabin and your friends Erica and Ransom in their respective homes nearby.

The absence of Kate is palpable as you reflect on that night when she decided to catch up with Erica and Ransom, leaving her bike behind while promising to meet later. Your mother insisted you leave for the city, an event that marked your last encounter with Kate before her sudden disappearance.

Sifting through the newspaper articles from those days reveals a sense of despair as leads faded and investigations reached dead ends. The police initially focused on Kate's parents and Phil Bennington, the reclusive writer who rarely left his cabin. However, everyone was eventually cleared, leaving behind only uncertainty and grief.

The return to Lost Lake the following year is a bittersweet experience for you as your family revisits the place that once held such joy but now bears Kate's absence like an unbearable void. Despite knowing deep down that there would never again be laughter, secrets whispered under the stars, or the warmth of summer sunsets shared with her, hope still lingers in your heart.

As you look through these photos after all these years, you find a poignant image from the last day on the island – a picture capturing the raw emotions of that moment when friendship and love intertwined amidst loss. In disbelief, you hold it closer to scrutinize every detail in the hope of finding closure or perhaps just one clue as to what truly happened to Kate.

In sorting through these pictures, you find comfort in revisiting those moments with your friends, seeking answers and healing from within yourself while grappling with the uncertainty that shrouds Kate's fate.","h f p z"
"10",10,"Blowing in the Wind",10,104,"3/6/2024","Every day just before sunrise I walked down to the beach to await the first light. I wanted to feel the stillness and get into a quiet state of meditation. On this day, I needed the answer to a question. Not just any question. A big one. What was I meant to be doing with my life?

I left my job as a sales manager in a car dealership because it felt hollow. The excitement of someone picking up a new car with a bow from the showroom was satisfying the first few times, but it lost its appeal after a few hundred. There had to be something more fulfilling. If there was, I hadn’t found it. I didn’t know what else I was good at. And my money was running out. I needed a job to keep a roof over my head. So, I began my morning ritual meditation to seek answers. I just got more questions. What brings you joy? What is your overarching purpose? How can you serve others? Until finally, why did your soul come here?

How the hell would I know?

I thought meditation was meant to change your life by giving you the answers, not serving up more questions. How did I know why my soul came to earth? Isn’t that something that should have made itself known when I was a child? Isn’t that what they say? What did you like to do when you were little? I can hardly remember my childhood, let alone the things I liked to do. I pretty much kept to myself. Listened to music. Read science fiction books. Nothing there to suggest my soul purpose.

I was walking to the sand to get ready to greet the new day and enter a meditation when I noticed everything was particularly dark, the sky thick with clouds. The moment I sat on my towel and crossed my legs to begin, the beach became darker and a strong wind whirred around me as though it had been waiting for me.

What could you be wanting to tell me? I thought. Am I crazy for thinking nature could speak to me? Indigenous cultures believe it. Why can’t I?

I closed my eyes and listened for words on the wind, or a random thought in my mind. Nothing. Just a howling. The wind blew more strongly and the howling became louder. Still no insights, just frustration. I tried to ignore the wind and meditate as normal, but the wind was making my heart race and distracting me from finding stillness in my mind. I opened my eyes. It was obvious there wouldn’t be a peaceful sunrise to create a backdrop for my meditation. It would be a grey, blowy morning at best. Why bother trying to meditate? Suddenly I wanted to go back to bed and shelter from what was surely an impending storm.

Maybe the wind was trying to tell me I was pushing too hard for an answer. It was certainly pushing against me as I tried to walk back to my friend’s holiday apartment that they’d let me use for a couple of weeks to ‘find myself’. Even nature was making life hard for me. I was nearly at the edge of the sand when I felt something stick to my leg. It was a piece of paper.

Now nature is throwing things at me. Luckily, it wasn’t a beer bottle.

I was about to discard the paper in the bin as its original owner should have done, when it occurred to me to inspect it more closely. I still wanted to believe that something greater than me might want me to know the answer to my question of what I was meant to do with my life.

Looking at it closely, the paper appeared to be crumpled. It contained a letter.

Maybe someone wrote the letter and decided not to send it. If they screwed it up and threw it on the beach, the wind must have unravelled it. How else would it have landed on my leg? What are the chances of it landing on me in any case. It’s such a big beach.

Cafes across the road were already open, so instead of going back to the apartment I decided to grab a coffee and watch the storm from a dry spot in the window. I folded the letter and pushed it into my pocket.

Why would someone throw away a letter? Was it something they needed to get off their chest and never intended to send it? Was it a rough draft for the real thing? Maybe I could deliver it to the person it was meant for. Is my purpose to deliver messages to people? A postman. Nah!

From my window spot, I gazed out at the beach, the wind whipping the waves into a fury and blasting the fronds of the palms that lined the street. I thought about the fate of postmen and women, who seemed to have all but lost their purpose in the digital age. As brought home to me long ago in David Brin’s 1980s post-apocalyptic dystopia novel The Postman, posties once had an important role in connecting people and helping them feel a sense of belonging. I wonder if any of them struggled with their purpose diminishing. Wanting to become posties from childhood and then technology taking it away from them one letter at a time. Maybe they were at a crossroads like me.

The young barista brought my long black to the table in an extra large mug. He was frowning.

“Hopefully your mood picks up once you’ve tasted our coffee,” he said.

“It may take more than coffee. Look at this weather.”

“I love storms. They bring a lot of energy through, clean things out and make space for change.”

“If you say so.” I took a sip of the coffee. “Wow, mate, this is amazing.”

The barista pulled his mouth and nodded as though he’d known one taste would be all it took. He went back behind the counter.

My thoughts returned to the discarded letter in my pocket. With the coffee in front of me, I felt ready to read it and even discover something about the author. I put the now-folded letter on the table. The creases and bumps of the dirty paper made it look rejected and unwanted. Was that me? Stumbling around in the world with no purpose and no place to be, discarded and blown around by the wind? Did I really want to know what was inside? Maybe it held a doomsday message that would fill me with all the horror of the post-apocalyptic world of that Brin novel. Just the memory of it was making me feel dread. And I had enough worry about my future without fiction, or this letter, making it worse.

Maybe this was a bad idea. Curiosity killed the cat and all that. Am I just being a coward? My own worst enemy? Just read the damn thing!

I took another sip of the aromatic dark liquid and unfolded the crumpled paper. I held my breath.

Dear future self

You have been going through a rough time and I wanted to let you know that you’re going to be all right.  

You have survived dark nights of the soul in the past and this one is no different. You will come out the other side once the storm has passed with renewed hope and purpose.

You are meant to write. You have been a reader for so long. Now it’s time to put all those thoughts of yours into words on a page for others to read.

If you don’t believe me, look out for a rainbow. It will be your sign.

Always

Your number one cheerleader

","

The tears were streaming down my face. I had written this letter to myself after my first sunrise beach meditation nearly two weeks before. Immediately, I had doubted the insights, scrunched it up and thrown it on the beach in frustration. As the wind now blew through the palms and whipped up the waves, I knew I didn’t need a rainbow for proof of what I was meant to do when the storm had passed. In fact, I wouldn’t even wait for the storm to pass. I would bring my laptop back to this window spot and write with the wind blowing around me. ","I stared at the letter, my heart pounding. The words seemed to glow on the page, as if they were written just for me. Could this be a coincidence? Or was it a message from the universe, delivered by the wind?

I glanced out the window. The storm was still raging, the sky a tumultuous swirl of grey and black. No sign of a rainbow. I sighed and took another sip of my coffee, trying to process what I had just read. Write? Me? I had never considered it. Sure, I loved reading, but writing was a different beast altogether. Could I really do it?

The barista came over to refill my mug. ""Everything okay?"" he asked, noticing my furrowed brow.

""Yeah, just... thinking,"" I replied, folding the letter and slipping it back into my pocket. ""Do you believe in signs?""

He chuckled. ""Depends on the sign. Why?""

I hesitated, then decided to share. ""I found this letter on the beach. It feels like it was meant for me. It says I should start writing.""

The barista's eyes widened. ""That's wild. Maybe you should listen to it.""

""Maybe,"" I said, though doubt still gnawed at me.

I finished my coffee and left the café, the letter burning a hole in my pocket. The wind had died down a bit, but the sky was still overcast. I walked back to the beach, my mind racing. Could I really be a writer? What would I even write about?

As I reached the sand, I noticed something strange. The clouds were parting, just a little, and a sliver of sunlight broke through. I watched in awe as the light spread, illuminating the stormy sky. And then, there it was—a rainbow, faint but unmistakable, arching across the horizon.

I stood there, stunned. The letter's promise echoed in my mind. A sign. This was my sign.

I pulled out the letter and read it again, my eyes lingering on the final words. ""You are meant to write.""

A sense of calm washed over me. Maybe I didn't have all the answers yet, but I had a direction. I had a purpose. I turned away from the beach, a newfound determination in my step. It was time to start writing my own story.","<brainstorm>
1. The letter was written by the protagonist in the future and somehow traveled back in time to reach them at this crucial moment.
2. The barista is actually a mystical figure or guardian angel who orchestrated the entire event to guide the protagonist.
3. The protagonist finds another letter or clue that leads them to a hidden treasure or a significant place that holds the key to their purpose.
4. The storm itself is a metaphor for the protagonist's internal struggle, and the letter is a manifestation of their subconscious mind.
5. The protagonist meets someone in the café who turns out to be a famous author or mentor who helps them realize their potential.

Best Idea: The letter was written by the protagonist in the future and somehow traveled back in time to reach them at this crucial moment. This twist will recontextualize the protagonist's journey and provide a satisfying resolution to their quest for purpose.

</brainstorm>

<ending>
I stared at the letter, my mind racing. The words felt oddly familiar, as if they were echoing thoughts I had never dared to voice. ""You are meant to write."" The phrase resonated deep within me, stirring a long-buried passion.

As I pondered the letter's origin, a sudden flash of memory hit me. I had written a similar letter years ago during a particularly dark period in my life, but I had never sent it. Could it be possible that this letter was from my future self, somehow sent back to guide me now?

I glanced out the window, the storm still raging. The barista's words about storms bringing change echoed in my mind. I took another sip of coffee, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over me. Maybe this storm was indeed a harbinger of transformation.

Just then, a break in the clouds revealed a sliver of sunlight. I watched in awe as a rainbow began to form, its vibrant colors arching across the sky. My heart leapt. The letter had mentioned a rainbow as a sign. This couldn't be a coincidence.

I folded the letter carefully and placed it back in my pocket. The storm outside was beginning to subside, and with it, the storm within me. I felt a newfound clarity and purpose. I was meant to write. All those years of reading and absorbing stories had been preparing me for this moment.

I left the café, the wind now a gentle breeze at my back, and headed back to the apartment. I knew what I had to do. I would start writing, pouring my thoughts and experiences onto the page. Maybe my words could help someone else find their way, just as this mysterious letter had helped me.

As I walked, I couldn't help but smile. The universe had a funny way of guiding us, sometimes through the most unexpected means. And perhaps, just perhaps, I had found my purpose after all.

","I stared at the letter, my heart pounding. The words seemed to leap off the page, resonating with a truth I had been too blind to see. Write? Me? The idea seemed absurd, yet strangely compelling. I had always been an avid reader, losing myself in the worlds crafted by others. Could I really create my own?

I glanced out the window at the stormy beach, the wind still howling and the waves crashing with relentless fury. A rainbow? In this weather? It seemed impossible. But then again, so did the idea of me becoming a writer.

I folded the letter and slipped it back into my pocket, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over me. Maybe this was the answer I had been seeking. Maybe the storm was a metaphor for the chaos in my mind, and the rainbow would be the clarity I needed.

I finished my coffee and decided to take a walk along the beach, despite the weather. The wind whipped at my clothes and the sand stung my face, but I felt a newfound determination. I would give this writing thing a try. What did I have to lose?

As I walked, I thought about the books I had read, the stories that had moved me, and the characters that had stayed with me long after I had turned the last page. Could I create something that would have the same impact on someone else? The thought filled me with both excitement and fear.

I reached the edge of the water and stood there, letting the waves lap at my feet. The storm was beginning to subside, the wind dying down and the clouds starting to break apart. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of peace I hadn’t felt in a long time.

And then, as if on cue, a rainbow appeared. It was faint at first, but it grew brighter and more vivid with each passing moment. I stared at it in awe, feeling a surge of hope and purpose. This was my sign. This was my answer.

I turned and headed back to the apartment, my mind racing with ideas. I would start writing today. I didn’t know where it would lead, but I was ready to find out. The storm had passed, and a new chapter of my life was about to begin.

As I walked, I felt a sense of gratitude for the mysterious letter that had found its way to me. Whether it was a message from my future self or just a coincidence, it had given me the push I needed. I was ready to embrace my new purpose and see where it would take me.

And so, with the rainbow as my guide, I began my journey as a writer, ready to face whatever storms lay ahead."," As I finished reading the letter in silence, my eyes began welling up with tears. The words of encouragement and guidance from myself were exactly what I needed to hear. Suddenly, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders as if someone had taken all the doubt and fear away from me.

I wiped my face dry, feeling more awake than ever before. My fingers traced over the rainbow pencil drawing in the corner of the letter that I hadn't noticed until now. The barista was still working behind the counter when he approached my table with a plate full of muffins and pastries.

""On the house,"" he said, ""for someone who looks like they could use it.""

I took one bite of the flaky croissant, savoring its buttery taste as I pondered over the letter. The words had struck a chord within me, igniting a fire that burned with creativity and inspiration. Perhaps I didn't have to find my purpose right away, maybe it was already inside me waiting for an opportunity to be discovered.

I sat at the table until the coffee mug was empty and the letter had been folded back up neatly in my pocket. As I walked out of the café into the chilly morning air once again, a glimmer of hope shone through the grey clouds above me like sunlight peeking through a parting storm cloud. The barista's kind gesture and the letter had given me more than just warmth on that cold day; they had provided me with an unexpected gift of self-belief and motivation to move forward in life, towards my true calling as a writer.

From then on, I started jotting down thoughts, ideas, even snippets from conversations overheard at the coffee shop or passersby walking along the beach. Words began flowing like water from a tap, and soon enough, pages of text filled with my own voice were being born into existence. The barista's words about rainbows as signs seemed to come true when I saw one stretched across the sky on my way back home, a vibrant arch of colors against the gloomy atmosphere that had surrounded me just moments before.

The letter and its message became my daily reminder; it was like an anchor in rough seas, keeping me grounded to my true self as I navigated through the uncertainty ahead. The storm passed eventually, leaving a fresh new world waiting for me, one where words on paper would be my connection with others - helping them feel less alone and more hopeful about their own paths, just like myself before reading that letter from future me.","z p f h"

Delete.

“Wait!” I straightened in my chair and threw a hand up. Hot coffee slushed over my glass cup and onto my other hand; to my dismay, my white pants. I ignored the sting and said, “He was gonna say something important.”

“When does Craig ever say anything important? All the man does is complain about this whole apartment complex, from how wet the water is to how electric the lights are. If you weren’t only a fourth of his age, I’d think he’s tryna smash.” Gabe scrolled through the rest of my voicemail once more, double-checking the caller ID list, before crossing the living room and passing my phone back to me. “Guy’s a lunatic.”

I sighed and studied the crack on my phone screen. At the top, it displayed 10:26am. The same time Craig called me last night; the same time I angrily tossed my phone onto my side table to silence that deafening, middle-of-the-night shriek before the phone slid like a hockey puck and hit the floor with a loud crack! Gabe awoke instantly and didn’t believe me when I explained it was our hallway neighbor for the twelfth day in a row.

“Well, Babe. I blocked his number,” Gabe reassured, grabbing his black jacket from the entryway closet. He shrugged it on and pulled a black beanie over his thick, dark hair. “If we see him in the halls, we’ll just say your phone’s broken and can’t receive calls.”

“What if he starts knocking on the door?”

“We’ll deal with it then. I know I work a lot, but you can always tell him to call me instead. He has both our numbers; he just thinks you’re nicer.” Gabe kissed me goodbye and hurried off for work; exactly where I needed to be in a few hours.

As annoyed as I felt, I couldn’t shake the uneasiness in my stomach. 

Why did Craig always have to call after hours? Why had his paranoia escalated so profoundly these last few weeks? He truly was a nice man; his adult grandkids stopped by to visit him occasionally, and the first week we moved in, he brought me some fresh cilantro he grew on his very own balcony. All of his concerns revolved solely around keeping our apartment clean and friendly, and that’s what he mostly called to complain about since our building did such a terrible job.

But why did it feel different this time?

I finished my coffee and got ready for work.

Throughout my day at the Cafe, I allowed these questions to evade between helping customers and wiping tables. Occasionally, I’d check my phone in case somehow Craig wasn’t blocked, but the absence of his name left a slight pang in my heart. Was I being too harsh? I always took his calls…I just couldn’t take them anymore. 

By the time my shift ended, my phone was buzzing in my back pocket again. Before I could unlock my car, I had the phone at my ear. “Hey, Craig.”

“You heard?”

The high-pitched voice definitely didn’t belong to Craig. “Oh, hey Anna.” I ducked into my car and shut the door. “What’s up?”

Anna lived beneath my apartment; we met one day when Gabe and I played our music too loud that Anna came knocking on our door with a bottle of Tequila in her hands shouting, ‘Can I crash this party?’ 

“Craig’s dead.”

I stopped mid-gearswitch. “Huh?”

“Craig. They found his body this morning.”

“What? Where?” Something twisted in my stomach. 

“In his apartment. I think his crippled legs finally gave out; his grandson found him lying in the kitchen with a gash in his head and the cats sleeping on him.”

I touched my throat and tried swallowing the lump forming there. How was he dead? When did he die? The last thing he said was…

“Craig had severe paranoia; one time he called security on me for falling asleep in the lobby when I blacked out one night. As sad as it is, I think everyone here will finally be able to breathe without a Karen micromanaging the halls.”

She had a point. But still…

I couldn’t help but imagine his poor, brittle body shrinking into the oversized black robe he always wore anytime he’d leave his apartment; his weak smile and friendly wave anytime he passed me with his cup of tea. Occasionally, his black cats followed him out, loyal as any dog, as he walked up and down the halls to admire the paintings of mountains and gorges spaced evenly on the walls.

I hoped he didn’t feel any pain.

We finished the phone call on a lighter note and made plans for her to drink with Gabe and I tonight. 

Gabe came home shortly after I did, and though I didn’t want to, we both mentioned Craig at the same time. Did you hear about Craig? We sat in silence, both likely thinking the same thing: what would have happened had we answered his calls? What about that last voicemail? Had he imagined something? Did that lead to his tragic fall?

Gabe suggested I unblock Craig so it wouldn’t appear suspicious in case anyone asked questions, so I did. As far as recovering voicemails…it was too late for that. All we could do was hope his grandkids didn’t come to us looking for mementos of Craig we might’ve accumulated in the four months we’d known him.

Anna came over that night and we drank, played cards, and blasted music a little louder than usual. It only quieted down when Anna said, “Poor Craig.”

The room thickened with tension.

Gabe nodded solemnly and looked at his feet.

Anna cleared her throat. “Did either of you talk to him recently?”

Gabe leaned over and grabbed a card from the center deck on the coffee table, a toothpick dangling from his mouth. His hazel eyes met mine. “He kept calling Dalia. Left tons of voicemails for her.”

Anna, sitting adjacent to me on the sectional, craned her neck to study me.

“They were all complaints,” I said, tossing an Uno card onto the pile. “But that last one…he was gonna mention something. He started by saying…we had a bigger problem? He warned me to not repeat it to anyone…and mentioned something about taking out the trash…”

“What the fuck,” Anna said.

“It was weird…” My stomach churched as I remembered my phone in my back pocket. “He kept complaining about building safety…he mentioned a new car parking over here recently? What could be bigger than people not following standard building safety protocol?”

“Literally anything,” Craig said. “You don’t think it was an accident?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I just wish we hadn’t deleted that last message.”

Over the next week, the building felt quieter; somber, even. It’s never a good feeling knowing someone in your building--let alone, right across the hall from you--passed on.

Eventually it did return to normal. Craig and I continued going to work, Anna stopped by a few times, occasionally bringing a friend, and the HOA continued sipping their White Claws and pretending nothing bad ever happened in our building. 

I never saw the beige Mercedes Craig mentioned; every other car had a parking permit.

No one left any socks in the lobby door; everyone still used their keycards.

Maybe Craig really was senile.

At one point, I ran into Craig’s granddaughter just as she was emerging from his apartment.

When she made eye contact with me, her blue eyes carried sadness and fatigue, though she mustered a small smile. She held a box of personal belongings. “Hey.”

“Hi.”

“Dalia, right?”

I nodded. I’d just been scanning my keycard outside my door after a stressful day of work.

“You have any pets by chance?”

Pets? “No,” I said.

“Are you allergic to cats?”

“No,” I said again.

“Would you, by chance, want Craig’s cats? My brothers and I already have too many pets and our parents don’t want them. This box--and the cats--are the last things to clear out.""

“Oh.” My heart ached for her, and now it ached for those poor fur babies. We had enough strays roaming the streets around here, and his cats didn’t seem like high maintenance. “I can talk to my boyfriend.”

“Okay, here’s my number. Just let me know. I’ll give you his keycard.”

I thanked her, offered her a hug, and we said our goodbyes.

Later that night, Gabe and I discussed taking the cats, and after only a few seconds of hesitation, he agreed. It was the least we could do for the old man. 

I texted Craig’s granddaughter later that night, and she said she’d leave the keycard under my door at some point during the week.

Who would’ve thought, though, that Craig’s death wasn’t the worst news we’d receive that month? Who would’ve thought that Craig’s death finally prompted the HOA to listen to his calls?

It started with the letter. Everyone got it. The HOA added it to an email that went out to all residents in our building. Anna saw it first, then Gabe and I. We reread it over and over again, until our stomachs twisted with guilt and chills crawled down our spines.

‘Evening, Residents. On behalf of some reports we received by one of our late residents, it is with deep regret we inform you of a breach in our building. Last week, maintenance discovered trash, needles, and various undisclosed items in Apartment 362, and upon further police investigation, learned of an unknown occupant living in the building. Said occupant has since run, and police are handling the situation. Please continue to close lobby doors and report any unknown people or vehicles on behalf of resident safety. Thank you.’

Unknown vehicles.

Unknown occupant.

Craig was right. Something was off. He knew it. He saw it. And then…he died.

Could it have been connected?

It was a drug addict, Anna suggested.

He was a criminal, I added.

Maybe he was homeless? Gabe offered.

None of us had the answers. But I still remembered that last voicemail: Just the other day when I was taking out the trash, I--

Did Craig have a bad encounter with him?

Did the man notice Craig? 

Why didn’t he want me to tell anyone? He reported it to the HOA, so he didn’t have any problem with someone knowing, unless…

Was there something else? Was there additional information only I needed to know?

I couldn’t stop the stream of questions from cutting into my sleep, haunting me in my dreams, creating new realities imagined each time I parked in the lot, or scanned my keycard, or climbed the stairs to our floor. They became relentless, harrowing, insistent, even, as if there was something I could have done differently on my part and I couldn’t rest until I pieced it together.

At one point, I found myself taking an extra flight up the stairs to stand outside apartment 361, but it was barricaded with yellow caution tape and a warning about fines and jail time if tampered with.

“It’s just weird,” I said one night as Gabe and I ate Chinese food at the table. “Craig leaves a string of voicemails, warns us about something, turns out he’s right, and he’s dead?”

Gabe scrolled through his phone and popped a piece of sesame chicken in his mouth. “Don’t let his paranoia get to you, Babe. It’s just the guilt of not answering him. What could you have done?”

“I don’t know. Called the HOA with him? Knocked on his door right after that last voicemail?”

“Well, if you bring it up now, the voicemails are gone. I’m sure they could recover them somehow, but why stir up something and stress out his family more? They didn’t find anything strange. Let the man rest in peace and let his family grieve him peacefully.”

He had a point. I was scaring myself. Guilt gnawed at my bones. At least in the future, I wouldn’t ignore any calls…even if they were excessive.

The next morning, I finally mustered the courage to pick up Craig’s cats. His granddaughter had left the keycard earlier in the week, I just couldn’t bring myself to enter his apartment yet. As far as I knew, the cats had one of those self dispensing feeders, so I chose to rely on it for as long as I could. 

Now? The least I could do--the only thing I could do--was take care of Craig’s cats. 

It was Friday. Gabe worked, but I called out so I could get the cats and set everything up for them in our apartment. I scanned his keycard at the door, heard a click, and pushed my way inside. 

Cold air hit me. All that remained was a blue cat tower and the cat dishes by the sliding balcony door. I shut the door behind me and crossed my arms. 

Silence. I was certain my voice would echo if I spoke. 

One of the black cats peeked its head out of the tower. Uncertainty flooded his bright yellow eyes, and he studied me curiously.

“Hey, baby.” I crouched down and held out my hand. “It’s okay. Come here.”

The cat still didn’t move. It wasn’t until I walked towards the cat bowl that he ran up to me and rubbed himself against my ankles.

Once again, I crouched down and petted him. He started purring. My heart broke. These babies had no idea what happened to their owner.

Except…that’s when I noticed it.

On his collar was a tiny square no bigger than a house key. I knew what it was because I’d seen it before: a cat cam. Some cat owners put one on their cats in case they ever got out. It made perfect sense Craig had one.

But wait. Had they been working that night?

I had the whole day, so I took my time: I played with the cats, gained their trust, and once I had the chance, put them in Craig’s cat backpack and transferred all the cat things, one by one, to mine and Gabe’s apartment.

The cats hid the moment I brought them inside, but I managed to take one of their collars off beforehand. How did these even work?

I pulled out my laptop and searched up how to download files--if there even were any--and spent the next hour trying to figure it out. 

Finally, after downloading the compatible app to my laptop and calling the company to give me a temporary password to log in (explaining the situation), I was able to access the files.

Several files over the last few weeks popped up. Instead of skipping or deleting any, I clicked on every. Single. One. Most of them merely contained the cats staring out the window or running around the house, or occasionally following Craig’s granddaughter around, until I caught one dating back to That Day.

It wasn’t the day Craig went to the trash. It was the day we deleted the voicemails. My heart stopped. My stomach sank. I only stopped because someone familiar caught my eye.

In that frame…was Gabe.

I clicked, ‘play.’

","

Someone knocked on the door. 

The cats stood back, watching.

Craig hobbled to the door.

Gabe: Hey! How’s it going?

Craig: Hi…

Gabe: Look, about what you saw by the trash the other night…it’s not as bad as you think. My friend Jackson just needs time to get back on his feet. No one’s lived in that apartment since we moved in, so I’m only helping him till then. He’s a good guy in a bad situation. We won’t throw needles away there again. Just don’t call the cops on him, okay?

Craig: He can’t live here, rent free.

Gabe: I’ll pay it back.

Craig: It’s unsafe. We don’t know anything about him.

Gabe: I do. I promise, it’s fine.

Craig: Does Dalia know?

Gabe: No. Let’s keep it that way.

Craig: I left her a voicemail. She’s gonna hear it sooner or later.

Gabe: It’s gone now.

Craig: Well, let’s call her right now! You’re one filthy--

Craig hobbled to the phone. The cat followed. In the frame, only two pairs of feet showed: Craig’s fuzzy black slippers, Gabe’s black work boots. There was a crash, a thud! And then…Craig was on the floor.

From there, the cats crawled on top of him, purring, and the door slammed shut.

I looked up from my screen. Suddenly, I felt like puking. 

He knew. This whole time…he knew.

Why couldn’t I just answer the phone?","The video started with a shaky view of the living room, the cat's perspective as it wandered around. Craig's voice could be heard in the background, mumbling to himself. The cat jumped onto the couch, and the camera angle shifted, capturing the front door. 

The door opened, and Gabe stepped inside. My heart pounded in my chest. What was he doing there?

""Hey, Craig,"" Gabe said, his voice casual. ""I brought you some groceries.""

Craig appeared in the frame, his face lighting up with a smile. ""Oh, thank you, Gabe. You didn't have to.""

""It's no problem,"" Gabe replied, setting the bags on the kitchen counter. ""I wanted to check on you. You've been sounding pretty stressed lately.""

Craig sighed, rubbing his temples. ""It's this building, Gabe. I keep seeing things, hearing things. I don't know if it's my mind playing tricks on me or if there's really something going on.""

Gabe nodded sympathetically. ""I understand. But you know, sometimes it's better to let things go. Stress isn't good for you.""

Craig looked down, his expression troubled. ""I know, but I can't shake the feeling that something's wrong.""

Gabe moved closer, his tone soothing. ""Why don't you sit down and relax? I'll make you some tea.""

Craig nodded, shuffling to the couch. The cat followed him, the camera capturing every movement. Gabe busied himself in the kitchen, his back to the camera. 

Then, something changed. Gabe's posture stiffened, and he glanced over his shoulder at Craig, who was now sitting with his eyes closed, trying to calm himself. Gabe reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small vial and a syringe.

My breath caught in my throat. What was he doing?

Gabe approached Craig, the syringe hidden in his hand. ""Here, Craig. This will help you relax.""

Craig opened his eyes, looking up at Gabe with trust. ""Thank you, Gabe. You're a good friend.""

Gabe smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Just doing what I can.""

He injected the contents of the syringe into Craig's arm. Craig's eyes widened in surprise, then slowly closed as he slumped back against the couch.

Gabe stood there for a moment, watching Craig's lifeless body. Then, he turned to the cat, his expression cold and calculating. ""Sorry, old man. But you were getting too close to the truth.""

The video ended, and I sat there, stunned. Gabe had killed Craig. He had been the one behind everything, manipulating the situation to his advantage.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The man I loved, the man I trusted, was a murderer. And now, I was the only one who knew the truth.

I had to act fast. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911, my hands shaking. As I waited for the operator to answer, I glanced around the apartment, my mind racing. Gabe would be home soon. I had to get out of here before he realized what I had discovered.

The operator's voice came through the line, and I quickly explained the situation, giving them all the details. They assured me that help was on the way.

I grabbed the cat carrier and my keys, my heart pounding in my chest. I had to get out of here, and I had to make sure Gabe paid for what he had done.

As I stepped out of the apartment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. The man I thought I knew was a monster, and now, I was in a race against time to bring him to justice.","<brainstorm>
1. Gabe is the unknown occupant: Gabe has been living a double life, and Craig discovered his secret. Gabe's frequent absences and dismissive attitude towards Craig's concerns were a cover for his illicit activities. Craig's last voicemail was a warning about Gabe, which is why he didn't want Dalia to tell anyone.

2. Anna is involved: Anna, the seemingly friendly neighbor, is actually involved in the illegal activities. She befriended Dalia and Gabe to keep an eye on them and ensure they didn't get too close to the truth. Craig's last voicemail was about seeing Anna with the unknown occupant.

3. Craig's death was a murder: Craig didn't die from a fall; he was murdered by the unknown occupant. The occupant discovered Craig's attempts to alert the HOA and silenced him. The cat cam footage reveals the murder, and Dalia must decide whether to go to the police.

4. The HOA is corrupt: The HOA is involved in illegal activities, and Craig's complaints were getting too close to exposing them. They orchestrated his death and covered it up. The cat cam footage shows a member of the HOA entering Craig's apartment on the night of his death.

5. Gabe is undercover: Gabe is actually an undercover cop investigating the illegal activities in the building. He couldn't reveal his true identity to Dalia for her safety. Craig's last voicemail was a warning to Dalia to trust Gabe and not get involved.

Best Idea: Gabe is the unknown occupant. This twist recontextualizes his dismissive attitude and frequent absences, providing a shocking yet plausible explanation for Craig's death and the mysterious activities in the building.

I clicked, ‘play.’

The footage showed Gabe entering Craig’s apartment. My heart pounded as I watched him move stealthily, his eyes darting around. He seemed to be searching for something. Suddenly, Craig appeared in the frame, his face a mix of confusion and fear.

“Gabe? What are you doing here?” Craig’s voice trembled.

Gabe’s expression hardened. “You’ve been snooping around too much, old man. You should’ve kept your nose out of other people’s business.”

Craig backed away, but his frail body couldn’t move fast enough. Gabe lunged at him, and the camera captured the struggle. Craig fell, hitting his head on the kitchen counter. The cats scattered, and Gabe stood over Craig’s motionless body, breathing heavily.

I paused the video, my hands shaking. Gabe… my Gabe… had killed Craig. The man I loved, the man I trusted, was the unknown occupant Craig had warned me about. The realization hit me like a freight train. Gabe’s frequent absences, his dismissive attitude towards Craig’s concerns—it all made sense now. He had been living a double life, and Craig had discovered his secret.

Tears streamed down my face as I replayed the last voicemail in my mind. Just the other day when I took out the trash, I—

Craig had seen Gabe. He had tried to warn me, but I had deleted the message, dismissing it as another paranoid rant. My guilt was overwhelming, but I knew what I had to do.

I gathered the evidence and called the police, my voice trembling as I explained everything. They arrived quickly, and I handed over the footage. Gabe was arrested later that day, his betrayal cutting deeper than any wound.

As I sat in the now-empty apartment, Craig’s cats curled up beside me, I felt a strange sense of closure. Craig’s death had not been in vain. His warnings had finally been heard, and justice would be served. The building would be safe again, and I would never ignore a call for help again.

The cats purred softly, a comforting reminder of the man who had tried to protect us all. I vowed to take care of them, just as Craig had taken care of us. And as I looked out the window, I knew that, despite the pain and betrayal, we would all find a way to heal.

","The video began with the cat perched on the windowsill, its collar camera capturing the dimly lit apartment. Craig’s voice could be heard in the background, mumbling to himself as he shuffled around the kitchen. The cat’s head turned sharply, and the camera followed its gaze to the front door, which creaked open slowly.

Gabe stepped inside, his face partially obscured by the shadows. My heart pounded in my chest as I watched him move stealthily, his eyes darting around the room. He approached Craig, who was now standing by the sink, oblivious to the intruder.

“Gabe?” Craig’s voice trembled with confusion. “What are you doing here?”

Gabe didn’t respond. Instead, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a small, metallic object. My breath caught in my throat as I realized it was a syringe. He moved swiftly, jabbing it into Craig’s neck. Craig gasped, his body convulsing before collapsing to the floor.

The cat jumped down from the windowsill, the camera capturing the scene from a lower angle. Gabe knelt beside Craig’s lifeless body, checking his pulse to ensure he was dead. He then stood up, wiping his hands on his pants, and began rummaging through the apartment.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. This couldn’t be real. Gabe, the man I loved, the man I trusted, had killed Craig. But why? What possible reason could he have?

The video continued, showing Gabe searching through Craig’s belongings, eventually finding a small, black notebook. He flipped through it quickly, his expression one of frustration and anger. He tore out a few pages, stuffed them into his pocket, and then left the apartment, closing the door quietly behind him.

I sat there, stunned, unable to process what I had just seen. My mind raced with questions. What was in that notebook? Why had Gabe done this? And most importantly, was I in danger?

I needed answers, but I couldn’t confront Gabe directly. Not yet. I had to be smart about this. I quickly copied the video file to a USB drive and hid it in my purse. I then deleted the app from my laptop and returned the collar to the cat.

When Gabe came home that evening, I tried to act normal, but my mind was a whirlwind of fear and suspicion. We ate dinner in silence, the weight of my newfound knowledge pressing down on me.

Later that night, as Gabe slept soundly beside me, I slipped out of bed and retrieved the USB drive. I needed to go to the police, but I couldn’t do it alone. I called Anna, my hands shaking as I explained everything to her.

“Meet me at the cafe in twenty minutes,” she said, her voice steady and reassuring. “We’ll figure this out together.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me, and hung up. I grabbed my purse and quietly left the apartment, my heart pounding with every step. As I walked down the dimly lit hallway, I couldn’t help but glance at Craig’s old apartment. The door was still sealed with caution tape, a grim reminder of the man who had tried to warn me.

I reached the cafe and found Anna waiting for me. She took one look at my pale face and pulled me into a tight hug. “We’ll get through this,” she whispered. “We’ll make sure Craig gets justice.”

With Anna by my side, I felt a glimmer of hope. We would go to the police, and Gabe would pay for what he had done. Craig’s death wouldn’t be in vain. And as we walked into the night, I knew that I had to be strong, not just for myself, but for Craig and his cats, who now depended on me.

The truth would come out, and justice would be served."," As you entered apartment 361 with cautious steps and a heavy heart, the atmosphere seemed to echo Craig's unsettling legacy—a tinge of mystery intertwined with the mundane details of his life that now lay still in disarray. The silence was palpable; it filled the room like an unwelcome guest, thickening as you approached the remnants of a once-vibrant space inhabited by Craig and his feline companions.

The lone cat from the tower eyed you warily—a guardian to its domain despite your intentions of caretaking. Your outstretched hand, an offering of peace, was met with hesitation as if it sensed the gravity of the moment and the weight on your shoulders. But curiosity is a powerful motivator, and eventually, trust bridged the gap between stranger and pet, allowing for the warmth of companionship to tentatively blossom in this otherwise chilling environment.

With gentle strokes that spoke volumes more than words ever could, you soothed the creature's nerves until it responded with a soft purr—a heartening sound amidst the quietude that now seemed almost conspiratorial. As if sensing an unspoken bond and perhaps drawing strength from your resolve, the cat relented to your touch and allowed itself to be cradled in your arms.

In this delicate dance of trust-building, you discovered the collar—a tiny sentinel that bore witness to Craig's everyday life through a lens small enough to be hidden beneath fur yet significant enough to capture moments otherwise lost to time. The realization was bittersweet; technology had immortalized his companions in their daily doings, unaware of the chaos that now gripped your world.

As you settled into Craig's armchair with the laptop and a fresh pot of coffee—a ritual meant to ward off the cold chill creeping through the room—you delved into this unfamiliar territory of digital memory retrieval, each file an echo from the past, until one beckoned you back in time.

The date on that particular video seemed innocuous at first glance; another day captured amongst countless others. But as fate would have it, your gaze was drawn to a figure partially obscured by the corner of the frame—a face that bore an uncanny resemblance to Gabe's. The hairline, the posture, even the subtle tilt of the head carried his signature nuances.

Your finger hesitated above the mouse before clicking with a mix of trepidation and resolve; you were about to confront a past that had been buried under layers of voicemails now lost to time. The screen flickered, bringing forth the image—a frozen fragment in which Gabe was not just present but central to a narrative thread begging for unraveling amidst Craig's otherwise serene domestic tableau.

As you leaned into your seat, coffee forgotten and breath caught in anticipation, each pixelated scene from that day promised answers yet carried with it the potential to upend everything you thought you knew about Gabe—and about life itself within these walls of 361.","h p z f"
"12",12," Curtis and the Curious Current ",12,496,"3/8/2024","Two pairs of small hands claw toward a cyan sky frosted with cirrus froth, but helium conquers gravity, and a frayed inch of twine taunts curled fingertips as the Pantone-perfect yellow orb rises largely unnoticed over the celebrant crowd.

Chastened by a yelp of frustration, the hapless child unconsciously backs a step. Retreat becomes escape as a towering shadow falls over both. The balloon flees lazily in the opposite direction as the shamefaced child seeks the raucous safety of pin-the tail commencing on the lawn. A glance back at the boy squirming in the growling shadow’s grip, and the incident already recedes, drifting into a dark mental corner as yellow retreats into cyan…

**

They find him some 15 miles northwest and 18 years ahead of the balloon’s remains. Both find rest amid the gathering leaves – he in the dead cover of a Central Illinois moraine, it in an aspen a mere 32 crow-feet from its launch point…

**

“Thing is, we’da likely never found it it hadn’t been a Swedish Aspen,” the tree doctor told Curtis. Brad deBoer held no doctoral honors, not even a community associate’s in silviculture. But the tricked-out green trailer at the curb conferred the title on deBoer and his father before him and his brother beside him sucking on an energy drink.

“Mm,” Detective Mead said.

“Bet the neighbors loved this guy,” Brad elaborated, nodding toward what resembled five mathematically aligned graves along the former back fence line. “See, the root system grows and spreads like kudzu. They’re hell on drainage tile and septic systems and underground lines. Nursery guy probably conned the idiot into planting the things – they look cool, and probably cost an arm and a leg. Guy didn’t know what he was getting into – this is what you’d call an ‘invasive’ species.”

“Mm,” repeated Curtis. He shook the marked Ziploc bag with the string and attached note. “So what’s that gotta do with this?”

“Gettin’ to that,” Brad muttered implausibly. “On average, you get a wire or cable embedded in the trunk or branches, it’ll hurt or even kill the tree. But if the tree has what they call the right plasticity, you know, like plastic gives (Curtis’ fingers clenched), the tree adapts and can grow around it, especially something small and pliable. Most of the times, that’s your smaller trees – your dwarfs and ornamentals. But some of your taller, what they call columnar trees like Italian Cypress, Japanese White Birch, Norway Spruce, and this bad boy got that same plasticity. We were talking a regular poplar or maple or elm, heat and rain and snow woulda destroyed your note a long time ago. As it is, the aspen protected it like some kinda time capsule or something. Good thing I was taking this one down – Wayne’s too dumb to have caught it, and wouldn’t have give a shit, anyway.” Dr. Wayne tipped his taurine bomb agreeably. “But I got kids of my own, and it hit me in the gut.”

Curtis smiled patiently. “You still got the piece of wood you cut this from?”

 Brad scanned the surrounding ground. “Do I need to tell the new owner this is a crime scene or something?”

“If it was,” Det. Mead rumbled, “it’s been contaminated all to shit by now.” 

**

“Might have been helpful if you’d left the whole thing intact.”

“Surgery’d already been done,” Curtis shrugged, settling on a stool next to a dirty chunk of wood. Denny Collingswood at least was a doctor, albeit with a P and an afterthought lab/office near the University Ag School loading dock. “That mean you can’t do it?”

The cop reached for the evidence bag, and the professor snatched it away. University crowd didn’t see limitations – just egos. The silviculturist peered at the hunk of aspen, at Brad’s incisions, at the discoloration where the tree doc had liberated the tiny scroll. “Well, at least you brought me a reasonable cross-section, and the bark’s still intact. I think I can get you a ballpark. When you need it?”

The detective climbed off the lab stool. “I imagine there’s no huge rush.”

**

“What’s the big rush?” Chris demanded, swirling her McFlurry. “And why do I get the shit work?”

“No work is shit unless it is performed shittily,” Curtis informed the tech. “Right tool for the right job. Dr. Denny knows his trees, while you are the reigning queen of trace.”

“I think you just called me a tool along with the borderline sexism.” Chris adjusted her baby bump and the vintage OfficeMax chair some distant city budget had endowed. “But since I don’t care for prenatal Dutch elm disease...”

“Now I know I made the right decision, Nature Girl.”

She flipped him off. “Lucky this was written in crayon – I’d probably had to bring out the message chemically. ‘HELP HES A MONSTER.’ Shit. This is the world I’m binging little Grissom into?”

“It helps,” Curtis consoled, “I think this was written at least 20 years ago. Same old shitshow.” 

Chris noisily sucked the last of her McFfluvia. “Your tree preserved the knot tied around the note, though your hypothetical 25 years of summer heat and winter weather probably released what looks to be a second exposed knot. How high your tree guy find this?”

“Dr. Brad said maybe 15 feet. You’re already ahead of me. Up, up, and awaaaayyy…”

“You’re an old soul,” Chris observed. “Prehistoric.” 

**

“A message on a balloon,” Lt. Twitchell stated. Again. Initially, Curtis had been grateful the body was found in a state refuge. Otherwise, he’d be dealing with the third-term county sheriff, who’d only recently issued an ambivalently finger-wagging half-apology for his deputies’ supremacist social media hijinks. The ISP’s Zone 5 commander was probably 60 IQ points beyond Buford Pussbag, but maybe not so imaginative. 

“I was beginning to think the connection was bad.”

“Look, what do you want? Clearly, this was some kind of prank, at best some poor kid venting.”

“I’d probably agree with you, except where we found the note. You heard of the Casey Grant case? The kid found in the Wild Oaks Moraine back in 2006? Went missing in 2004?”

“Of course, only murder ever in the park. Case is still open. You think this balloon note is some kind of break?” 

“This balloon note was found maybe 10 feet from Casey Grant’s house, in the neighbor’s tree. You crack open that open file, you’ll find the boy disappeared two weeks after his eighth birthday. You got kids, Lieutenant?”

“Three,” she responded, warily.

“You keep a helium tank on standby?”

The line went momentarily silent. “So to repeat, what do you want from me?”

“Think I already got it.”

**

“I need a lawyer or something?” Will Grant asked as he sidestepped another onslaught of liberated children. Several moms and a dad or two peeked toward the assistant principal and the cop, a few glaring at the man who’d abruptly commandeered a gap in the pickup line. 

“Your dad passed a while back, right?” Curtis employed his library voice, even amid the glee and tumult. “Can’t see why you need one.”

“Dad was no monster,” Grant said pointedly, leaning slightly toward the detective with a smile for a millennial mom about eight feet away. “See, you show me this note and tell me maybe Casey wrote it, you get why I might feel like I need legal counsel.”

The millennial clearly was waiting for something to break. Millington was a campus town, and Amelia Rayburn Elementary was equidistant from the tidy junior faculty homes to the east and the stretch to the west where the sidewalks began to crumble. Cops were an unsettling presence either direction and especially at this point between.

“I wouldn’t have bothered you here if I didn’t see a possible lead in your brother’s case,” Curtis said. “Your folks have a party for Casey’s eighth birthday?”

Grant sighed. “Dad and Mom always had all our friends over every birthday, at least ‘til, well, you know.”

“You know anybody took any video?”

A smile finally broke through. “Mom was the official documentarian – Ken Burns coulda done a PBS marathon just on our birthdays.”

“Your mom still got those videos?”

“Mom’s in Heritage Alzheimer Care over on Poplar – early onset, they say, but I think Dad…dying…after Casey’s disappearance was just more than she could handle. But I got the birthday videos digitized a few years back. Know what, I got a staff meeting in about 20, but if you want, I can pull ‘em out again when I get home in, oh, about an hour-and-a-half. Maybe I’ll pop some corn.”

“Wife’s got a church thing tonight,” Curtis noted. “Make it pizza instead.”

**

As long as Rich Neely wasn’t in a mood for war stories, Curtis calculated he could deadhead it back to Little Caesar’s and then Will Grant’s place within the hour. Neely had known him mainly as a uniform before he’d retired in ’15, and from all Curtis had heard through the sour-grapevine, he didn’t expect the former lieutenant had popped a cork when Officer Mead made Det. Mead.

“You know how it is,” Neely shrugged, easing the hood of a vintage Corvette as the late afternoon breeze picked up beyond the open garage bay. “Something like that happens, the cracks start forming and, eventually, everything crumbles. Casey and my girl Brenda went to grade school together — he was a sweet kid always wanted to help teacher or some littler kid getting hassled.

“Being a friend of the family, I had to sit mostly on the sidelines, but they tore this town apart trying to find the boy – grilled every creep on the Offender’s Registry. Ed and Dina Grant were a wreck, and poor Wil kinda got shuffled into a corner while the folks started playing the blame game and Ed sank into the booze. Between us, I had to straighten out a few DUIs for him, and after Ed, well, you know what happened, I wondered maybe I’d just let him take his medicine, he’d still be around and maybe Dina wouldn’t be in that shithole on Poplar.”

“Shoulda, woulda, coulda,” Curtis suggested.

Lt. Neely, Ret., tipped a Bud Lite. “Amen, Bro.”

Curtis easily found his way out.

**

The sky to the west was a rosy bruise and the Little Caesar’s a grease spot by the time Curtis fast-forwarded through a wobbly chorus of “Happy Birthday” and the dissection of a Walmart white-on-yellow with magenta and royal blue script. Grant smiled faintly as maybe 20 kids dispersed into largely gender-based cliques and parents gelled into semi-vigilant clumps. Casey rampaged with a day-glo super-squirter, scattering squealing boys and girls. Beyond the melee, a larger boy crossed the back lawn. Curtis leaned in.

“That you there?” the cop asked. 

Grant squinted. “Yep. I never really noticed before. What’ve I got there?”

As if on cue, the yellow object escaped Wil Grant’s grasp, snapping back on its tether.

““Looks like you’re heading toward that girl by the shed,” Curtis murmured, transfixed.

“Some kid in Casey’s class,” Wil frowned. “I was 11, and there weren’t any other kids my age at the party. I was bored shitless.” Grant’s brow furrowed as he watched himself call to the somber girl in the pink corduroy pants. “I remember now,” Wil breathed. “When I saw this little kid off to the side all by herself, I guess I felt bad for her. I gave her a balloon to try and cheer her up.”

“Or tried to,” Curtis observed as the girl lurched slightly back and the string slithered though her fingers. The detective watched the yellow balloon drift almost out of frame before an abrupt gust tugged it on a new trajectory. Curtis refocused on a man who’d rushed into frame and after a beat grabbed Wil’s arm. Then, the frame filled with blue.

“Yeah,” Wil drawled. “This dude begins yelling at me, telling me over and over she’s eight and what am I thinking. I’m trying to explain, but the girl’s run off. Then Mom comes roaring onto the scene. Just dropped the camera and came in guns blazing.”

“You don’t know who the guy was?”

Wil pursed his lips and shook his head. “Looks familiar, but after Casey, Mom and Dad drifted away from most of the other parents. Sorry.”

“S’okay,” Curtis said, numbly.

**

“You haven’t been watching your texts today, have you?” Chris scolded through the dashboard speaker as Curtis steered into the dusk along University. 

“Heavy day of snipe-hunting,” he sighed as he glanced at the sleeved DVD on the passenger seat. It wasn’t pepperoni gnawing at his gut. “You got something for me?”

“Not much. I called your tree guy at the university and he confirmed a couple decades’ growth around the note and twine, based on past insect damage and long-term climate patterns and, oh, gosh, just a bunch of scientific shit I’m too dumb to grasp.”

“Sensitive, much?”

“Mostly around the ankles and boobs, thanks for asking. I did confirm your balloon hypothesis. Rubber-plastic trace embedded in the cotton string fibers probably as the balloon deteriorated and the pieces dropped to the ground to get raked off with the fall leaves.”

“Brad the Treeologist told me Swedish aspens usually go yellow in the fall, so I wouldn’t be surprised.”

The dashboard went dead for a nanosecond. “Yellow?”

**

She wants nothing more than to run. But she’d begged and begged, just this one time. The others had stopped inviting her; they’d stopped asking her to play at recess. Just this one time. He finally gave in only because he was friends with Casey’s dad. Now, he’d NEVER leave, because she’d begged, because Casey’s mom had yelled at HIM, which nobody ever did. It would be bad at home.

He’s now laughing with the other dad. People always got over being mad at him quick. But she could tell everybody what He really was.

She heads for the abandoned table with what’s left of the cake and balloons secured to each corner. She spies a scattering of crayons from Casey’s new jumbo Crayola set, picks a Pea Green, tears a corner from a sheet of drawing paper, and quickly but carefully inscribes her brief message. She as carefully pries the tape from a red balloon bobbing above the demolished cake, rolls the paper into a scroll, knots the balloon string around the note.

“Who’s the monster?” 

She spins. Casey has been standing behind her, watching the whole process, curious and now concerned.

“Is he the monster?” he asks quietly, pointing at toward the huge man who’d yelled at his brother. “It’s OK. I won’t tell.”

Wide-eyed, she turns back to see her note floating over the neighbor’s fence. Casey moves closer as the first tears roll down her cheeks. 

“I wanted your mom or dad to find it, you know, after we went home. Somebody who can help us.”

“I’ll help you,” Casey smiles, patting her shoulder.

**

","

“I was hunting the wrong monster,” Curtis admitted. “No offense, though, obviously, the ship has sailed on that one.”

He settled onto the couch — an act of de-escalation likely wasted on one who was trained in the rules, the tricks of de-escalation. The Glock .22 neither dropped nor rose. Surrender doesn’t happen; violence happens in a blink. Curtis leaned into the stasis. 

“Somebody comes along, tries to pull the rug out from under everything, it can make you panic, do any horrible shit to protect yourself. Or somebody you love. I get it.”

“I was mad.” It just spilled out. “It was stupid, and I could have messed everything up. But he just wouldn’t let it go, even after I begged him to. You know what could have happened. Or maybe not. You even got kids?”

“No. But, look, my Dad was no walk in the park, either. He was a scary asshole when he got a load on, and gave me the belt more than a couple times. And I’d have fought like a wildcat anybody tried to take him away from us.”

Brenda Neely’s arm remained rigid, but something shifted in her face. She looked a little less like her dad, though not enough. She was still in her deputy’s uniform: Curtis had been waiting on her porch on the Millington outskirts when shift ended. He hadn’t wanted to do this at the sheriff’s, though that now seemed a questionable call.

“And that’s the thing,” Curtis continued. “I didn’t think your dad, whatever else he was, would kill a child on the off-chance somebody might believe him. Rich Neely was an important guy, a shrewd cop – some eight-year-old wasn’t going to bring him down. You couldn’t know that. Were you afraid of your dad losing everything, you getting taken away from him? Or was it how angry he’d be?”

The Glock wavered, slightly. “He was going to help me even if I didn’t want his help. The stupid little shit.” Brenda’s fingers tightened. “I had him meet me at the park, you know, over near the junior high, to beg with him one more time. He told me I was just scared of the monster and he’d tell his dad and maybe the police and save me and Mom. I don’t even remember what I picked up, but, you know, after... You think you know Him, but He didn’t yell or smack me or anything — just hugged me, said he’d take care of everything. I messed everything up, and he just took charge. You don’t know shit.”

“I know you were only eight,” Curtis began cautiously. “You put that gun down, lemme see if I can’t—“

“Help me?” Now the Glock jerked up an inch.

 It had been the dead-wrong move. He wasn’t a parent. But Lt. Twitchell was, as she’d eventually remembered. As the wall behind Brenda Neely abruptly lit up in red and blue, Curtis was grateful for it.","Curtis's mind raced as he replayed the video in his head. The girl in the pink corduroy pants, the note, the balloon, and Casey's innocent promise to help. He had to find her. He had to know who she was.

The next morning, Curtis sat in his office, staring at the old yearbook photos from Casey's school. He flipped through the pages, looking for any clue that might lead him to the girl. His phone buzzed, and he glanced at the screen. It was Chris.

""Got something for you,"" she said. ""I did some digging. The girl in the video? Her name is Emily Harper. She moved away a year after Casey disappeared. But get this—her father, Robert Harper, was a registered sex offender. He was never questioned in Casey's case because he had an alibi.""

Curtis's heart pounded. ""Where is she now?""

""She's back in town,"" Chris replied. ""Moved back a few months ago. Lives on the outskirts, near the old mill.""

Curtis grabbed his coat and headed out the door. He drove to the address Chris had given him, a small, run-down house at the edge of town. He knocked on the door, and a woman in her late twenties answered. Her eyes widened when she saw his badge.

""Emily Harper?"" Curtis asked.

She nodded, her face pale. ""Yes. Can I help you?""

""I'm Detective Curtis Mead. I need to ask you about Casey Grant.""

Her eyes filled with tears. ""I knew this day would come,"" she whispered. ""Come in.""

Curtis followed her inside. The house was sparsely furnished, and the air was thick with tension. Emily sat down on the couch, wringing her hands.

""I remember that day,"" she began. ""Casey's birthday party. I was so scared. My father... he was a monster. I wrote that note, hoping someone would find it and help me. But it got lost.""

Curtis leaned forward. ""Emily, did your father have anything to do with Casey's disappearance?""

She nodded, tears streaming down her face. ""He took Casey. I saw him do it. He threatened me, told me if I ever said anything, he'd kill me too. I was just a kid. I was terrified.""

Curtis's blood ran cold. ""Where is he now?""

""He's dead,"" Emily said. ""Died in prison a few years ago. But I never told anyone what I saw. I was too scared.""

Curtis stood up, his mind racing. ""Emily, thank you. You've just solved an eighteen-year-old mystery.""

As he left the house, Curtis felt a mix of relief and sorrow. Casey's family would finally have closure, but the scars of that day would never fully heal. The yellow balloon had carried a message of despair, but it had also led to the truth. And sometimes, the truth was the only thing that could set you free.","<brainstorm>
1. The girl who wrote the note is now an adult and has been living in fear of the ""monster"" all these years. She might have crucial information about Casey's disappearance.
2. The ""monster"" could be someone unexpected, like a well-respected community member or even a family member of one of the main characters.
3. The note could have been a red herring, and the real culprit behind Casey's disappearance might be someone else entirely.
4. The balloon note might have been part of a larger pattern of similar notes, indicating a series of abuses that were never connected until now.
5. The girl who wrote the note might have tried to warn others in different ways, leading to a trail of clues that Curtis and Chris can follow to uncover the truth.

Best Idea: The girl who wrote the note is now an adult and has been living in fear of the ""monster"" all these years. She has crucial information about Casey's disappearance, and the ""monster"" is someone unexpected, like a well-respected community member. This twist will recontextualize the earlier events and provide a satisfying resolution to the mystery.

<ending>
Curtis parked outside the modest bungalow, the last rays of the sun casting long shadows across the lawn. He double-checked the address Chris had texted him. This was it. He knocked on the door, and after a moment, it creaked open to reveal a woman in her late twenties, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and recognition.

""Detective Mead?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

""Yes, ma'am. Are you Emily?""

She nodded, stepping aside to let him in. The living room was cozy but cluttered, a stark contrast to the tension in the air. Emily gestured for him to sit, and they settled into opposite ends of a worn-out couch.

""I saw the news,"" she began, her voice barely above a whisper. ""About the note in the tree. I knew it was mine.""

Curtis leaned forward, his heart pounding. ""Emily, we believe that note is connected to Casey Grant's disappearance. Can you tell me what happened?""

Tears welled up in her eyes as she recounted the day of the party. ""I was so scared. He was always so nice to everyone else, but at home, he was a different person. I thought if I could just get someone to find the note, they would help me.""

""Who was he, Emily?"" Curtis asked gently.

She took a deep breath. ""Mr. Neely. He was a family friend, always around, always helping out. But he had this dark side. I didn't know how to tell anyone.""

Curtis felt a chill run down his spine. ""Rich Neely? The retired lieutenant?""

Emily nodded. ""He was the one who grabbed Wil that day. He was furious because he thought I was trying to tell someone about him.""

Curtis's mind raced. Neely had been involved in the investigation, had access to all the information. He could have easily manipulated the search efforts.

""Emily, do you know anything about what happened to Casey?"" Curtis asked, his voice urgent.

She shook her head. ""No, but I remember seeing Casey talking to Mr. Neely that day. I thought he was just being friendly, but now I wonder...""

Curtis stood up, his resolve hardening. ""Thank you, Emily. You've been very brave. We'll get to the bottom of this.""

As he left her house, Curtis called Chris. ""We need to bring Neely in for questioning. I think we've found our monster.""

The next morning, Curtis and Chris arrived at Neely's house with a warrant. The former lieutenant opened the door, his face a mask of confusion and anger.

""What's this about, Mead?"" he demanded.

""Rich Neely, you're under arrest for the abduction and murder of Casey Grant,"" Curtis said, his voice steady.

As they cuffed him, Neely's facade cracked, and he snarled, ""You have no idea what you're getting into.""

But Curtis knew they had finally uncovered the truth. The monster who had haunted Emily's childhood and taken Casey's life was now behind bars. The note, once a desperate cry for help, had become the key to solving a decades-old mystery. And for the first time in years, the town of Millington could begin to heal.

","Curtis parked his car outside the Heritage Alzheimer Care facility, the DVD still weighing heavily on his mind. He had to see Dina Grant, even if she might not remember much. He needed to know if she could identify the man in the video. 

Inside, the facility was warm and smelled faintly of antiseptic. A nurse led him to Dina’s room, where she sat by the window, staring out at the garden. Her eyes were distant, lost in a fog of memories.

“Mrs. Grant?” Curtis said gently, pulling up a chair beside her. “I’m Detective Curtis Mead. I’m looking into your son Casey’s case.”

Dina’s eyes flickered with recognition, but it was fleeting. “Casey… my little boy,” she murmured, her voice trembling.

“I have something I’d like you to see,” Curtis said, holding up the DVD. “It’s from Casey’s eighth birthday party. Do you think you could watch it with me?”

Dina nodded slowly, and Curtis set up the portable DVD player on the small table beside her. As the video played, Dina’s eyes widened, and she reached out as if to touch the screen.

“That’s my Casey,” she whispered, tears welling up in her eyes.

Curtis fast-forwarded to the part where the man grabbed Wil’s arm. “Do you recognize this man?” he asked, pausing the video.

Dina’s face contorted with fear and anger. “That’s… that’s him,” she said, her voice shaking. “That’s the monster.”

Curtis’s heart raced. “Do you know his name?”

Dina’s eyes darted around the room, as if searching for something. “He was… a friend of Ed’s. They worked together. His name was… Robert. Robert Hensley.”

Curtis felt a chill run down his spine. Robert Hensley had been a suspect in Casey’s disappearance but had an alibi that checked out. But now, with this new information, Curtis knew he had to dig deeper.

“Thank you, Mrs. Grant,” Curtis said, squeezing her hand. “You’ve been very helpful.”

As he left the facility, Curtis’s mind raced with possibilities. He needed to find Robert Hensley and see if he could connect him to the note and Casey’s disappearance.

**

Curtis sat in his car, staring at the address he’d scribbled on a notepad. Robert Hensley’s last known address was a small house on the outskirts of town. He took a deep breath and started the engine.

When he arrived, the house looked unassuming, with a well-kept lawn and a white picket fence. Curtis approached the front door and knocked. After a few moments, the door creaked open, and a middle-aged man with graying hair and a weary expression peered out.

“Mr. Hensley?” Curtis asked, showing his badge. “I’m Detective Curtis Mead. I’d like to ask you a few questions about Casey Grant.”

Hensley’s face paled, and he stepped back, allowing Curtis to enter. “I’ve already told the police everything I know,” he said, his voice shaky.

“I understand,” Curtis said, “but new evidence has come to light. We found a note written by a child, calling someone a monster. It was attached to a balloon that was found near Casey’s house.”

Hensley’s eyes widened, and he sank into a chair. “I didn’t… I didn’t hurt Casey,” he stammered. “I swear.”

Curtis studied Hensley’s face, searching for any sign of deception. “Can you tell me about the girl at the party? The one you yelled at?”

Hensley’s eyes filled with tears. “That was my daughter, Emily. She… she was always so scared of me. I didn’t mean to yell at her, but I was so angry. I thought Wil was trying to hurt her.”

Curtis’s heart ached for the man. “Where is Emily now?”

Hensley shook his head. “She ran away when she was sixteen. I haven’t seen her since.”

Curtis knew he had to find Emily. She held the key to unlocking the truth about Casey’s disappearance. As he left Hensley’s house, he felt a renewed sense of determination. He would find Emily and finally bring justice for Casey Grant.

**

Curtis’s search for Emily led him to a small town a few hours away. He found her living in a modest apartment, working as a waitress at a local diner. When he approached her, she looked at him with wary eyes.

“Emily Hensley?” Curtis asked, showing his badge. “I’m Detective Curtis Mead. I’m investigating the disappearance of Casey Grant.”

Emily’s face softened, and she nodded. “I remember Casey,” she said quietly. “He was a sweet boy.”

Curtis took a deep breath. “I need to know about the note you wrote. The one calling someone a monster.”

Emily’s eyes filled with tears. “I wrote that note about my father,” she said, her voice trembling. “He was abusive. I was terrified of him.”

Curtis felt a pang of sympathy. “Did your father have anything to do with Casey’s disappearance?”

Emily shook her head. “No. My father was a monster, but he didn’t hurt Casey. I saw Casey leave the party with a man I didn’t recognize. I tried to tell someone, but no one would listen.”

Curtis’s heart sank. He had been so close, but now he was back to square one. “Thank you, Emily,” he said, his voice heavy with disappointment.

As he drove back to Millington, Curtis couldn’t shake the feeling that he was missing something. He replayed the events of the party in his mind, searching for any clue he might have overlooked.

Then it hit him. The man who had taken Casey wasn’t a stranger. He was someone the boy trusted, someone who had been at the party all along.

Curtis’s mind raced as he pieced together the puzzle. He knew who the real monster was.

**

Curtis stood outside the house, his heart pounding. He knocked on the door, and a moment later, it opened to reveal Wil Grant.

“Detective Mead,” Wil said, surprised. “What are you doing here?”

Curtis took a deep breath. “I know who took Casey,” he said, his voice steady. “It was you, Wil.”

Wil’s face twisted in anger. “That’s ridiculous,” he spat. “I loved my brother.”

Curtis shook his head. “You were jealous of him. Your parents gave him all the attention, and you felt neglected. You took him to the moraine that day, didn’t you?”

Wil’s eyes filled with rage. “You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he growled.

Curtis stepped closer. “I know you didn’t mean to kill him. It was an accident. But you’ve been living with the guilt ever since.”

Wil’s shoulders slumped, and he sank to the floor, sobbing. “I didn’t mean to,” he cried. “I just wanted him to go away for a little while. But he fell, and I couldn’t save him.”

Curtis knelt beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “It’s over now, Wil. You can finally let go of the guilt.”

As Wil was taken into custody, Curtis felt a sense of closure. Casey Grant’s case was finally solved, and the monster had been unmasked."," In a small town nestled between the rolling hills and dense forests, Curtis was engrossed in unraveling the mysteries of his past through a series of recovered memories projected onto the screen before him. The latest snippet featured an old family video from Casey's birthday party – a seemingly innocuous event that held more weight than anyone could have imagined.

""Your task is’re heading toward that girl by the shed,” Curtis murmured to his colleague, Wil, transfixed by the unfolding drama of years gone by.

Wil frowned, recalling an awkward memory from his youth. ""Some kid in Casey's class,"" he recalled. ""I was 11, and there weren't any other kids my age at the party. I was bored shitless."" He watched himself on the screen reaching out to a somber girl dressed in pink corduroy pants with a balloon intended as consolation.

Curtis observed quietly, ""Or tried to,"" noting how she recoiled slightly and lost her grip on the string. His attention shifted momentarily when a man interrupted their interaction – his face flashed across Curtis' mind briefly before being overtaken by a blur of blue as he moved away from view.

""Yeah,"" Wil drawled, ""This dude begins yelling at me, telling me over and over she’s eight and what am I thinking. I was trying to explain, but the girl ran off."" He paused. ""Then Mom comes roaring onto the scene. Just dropped the camera and came in guns blazing.""

Curtis asked if Wil recognized the man who had yelled at him. With a furrowed brow, Wil shook his head apologetically. “Looks familiar, but after Casey, my parents drifted away from most of the other parents. Sorry.”

“S’okay,” Curtis said, numbly. The conversation shifted as Chris' voice came through on the dashboard speaker, a reminder that life continued beyond their current preoccupation with the past. He inquired about any new findings related to the case they were working on – an enigmatic note tied to a balloon found at a crime scene many years ago.

Wil had consulted Brad, a dendrochronologist from the university, who confirmed that the growth rings of the tree where the note was discovered indicated it was several decades old. This aligned with Curtis' theory about the rubber-plastic trace embedded in the cotton string fibers being remnants of a balloon that had decayed over time and whose pieces were eventually collected during yard work along with fallen autumn leaves.

Chris chuckled, ""Sensitive, much?"" to which Curtis replied about his own sensitive spots with self-deprecating humor. They both acknowledged the science behind Brad's findings without delving too deep into the complexities that lay beyond their grasp.

The scene shifted again as Curtis focused on a present unfolding at Casey’s current birthday party. A young girl, once isolated and friendless among her peers, was now desperate for attention – not just any attention but from the very parents who had become distant since Casey's arrival in their lives.

In an act of quiet rebellion against her solitude, she approached a table strewn with cake crumbs and deflated balloons to leave behind a message that could potentially unravel years of concealed truths. She used vibrant Crayola markers from Casey's new set to craft a note on the remaining paper, securing it to a red balloon with careful precision.

As the scene reached its conclusion and she released her makeshift messenger into the sky, another figure entered her frame – Casey, wide-eyed and visibly moved by what was happening before her.

""Who's the monster?"" she asked in a whisper so soft it barely disturbed the air around them. The question hung between them, laden with fear and curiosity as they both watched the balloon drift over the neighboring fence. With tears on his cheeks, Casey reached out for comfort – a small gesture of solidar vice amidst the chaos that threatened to unravel their reality.

""I wanted your mom or dad to find it,"" she explained with youthful wisdom beyond her years, ""Somebody who can help us."" And in that moment, Curtis knew he would not only be an observer of history but a participant as well – determined to offer the help this young girl so fervently desired.","f h z p"
"13",13," BOUND BY THE JERSEY ",13,88,"3/9/2024","She opened her eyes suddenly, feeling a sense of disorientation wash over her, making her head pulsate. The gleaming white ceiling with two latticed openings above her made her feel uneasy, while the coldness of the floor she lay on gave her chills. Her body shivered unconsciously at the mere thought of lying on the cold concrete floor. A little unsteadily, she managed to get up into a sitting position, thankful that the coldness of the concrete floor had disappeared, and started surveying the dimly lit room in which she was. She was not alone.

As she took in her surroundings, a musty odor assaulted her senses, mingling with the faint hum of ventilation machinery. The air was thick with tension, and she could hear the muffled sounds of distant voices echoing through the metal walls. Her heart pounded in her chest as her thoughts raced through her head, trying to figure out what kind of trouble she was and who these strangers around her were.

""Hey, you're awake,"" a voice said, breaking the silence. His tone was cautious but somehow soothing.

Her gaze snapped to the source of the voice—a tall, imposing figure with a stern expression. She estimated that the black man was over thirty years old, and judging by his build, he had been in the army, maybe even a policeman. She had never seen him before, but his presence offered a glimmer of security amid the chaos. His face did not reflect concern, a sign that the man had been in this situation before.

Next to him sat another stranger, an old man with a lean face decorated with a thick beard that seemed to add to his mysterious aura. The musty scent grew stronger, mingling with the faint smell of old paper and dust. ""Welcome to the party, young lady,"" he said with a wry smile, his voice husky. Looking at his old-fashioned suit, she thought he could be over sixty.

Taking a deep breath, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm Tracy. From New Jersey. How did we all end up here?""

""John, New Jersey, too,"" the black man smiled slightly at her. ""I woke up here and saw all of you. Frank was already awake."" He nodded to a bespectacled old man with a gray beard in an old-fashioned suit.

Frank half raised his right hand in greeting. ""New Jersey,"" he said in a hoarse voice. ""I have no idea how I ended up here.""

""I'm Olivia."" A small woman in a flower-design dress introduced herself, avoiding looking at anyone, her voice trembling with fear. ""Also, New Jersey.""

""I'm Mason, and I'm pretty sure we're all from Jersey. Is there anyone among us not from New Jersey?"" A skinny man with a bald head and big square glasses attracts attention.

The silence ruled the room.

Tracy's gaze swept over, landing on a woman with a commanding presence. Her demeanor exuded confidence mingled with a hint of arrogance. She was clad in an elegant suit, the epitome of sophistication amidst the stark surroundings.

Her meticulously styled blue hair hinted at a bold personality unafraid to defy convention. Tracy found herself both intimidated and intrigued by this enigmatic figure, wondering what role she played in their shared ordeal.

Before Tracy could gather her thoughts, the woman spoke up, her voice cutting through the uneasy silence. ""Mary Crowley, the Vice President of Crowley Industries. I demand an explanation,"" she declared, her tone firm and unwavering.

""Like all of us, I guess,"" Mason said harshly.

Mary gave him a look of disdain and then turned her attention to Frank, an older man with a beard.

""You seem like a person who could give insight into our situation,"" her voice sounded colder than the concrete floor they were sitting on.

Frank smiled weakly and shook his head. ""You flatter me, young lady, but I have no insight into our situation. I have not the slightest idea of what is happening to us.""

His explanation was not what she expected, and when her gaze swept over the faces of the others, she saw disappointment and contempt clearly outlined on her face.

""It looks like I'll have to ask someone more responsible for the answer,"" her arrogant voice said.

""Good luck with that,"" John added calmly, closing his eyes. ""There's no one here but us. Frank and I tried to call someone while you were sleeping but to no avail.""

Mary approached the metal door, acting like she hadn't heard John. She knocked on the door with her right hand forcefully, but nothing happened except that the clang of the blow resounded like a cathedral bell, forcing them to cover their ears with their hands.

""Stop doing that,"" Mason shouted, standing up and forcing John to stand up as well. The room was suddenly filled with tension.

Mary turned to Mason, her face emotionless, hard as stone. ""I won't allow you to address me like that,"" her voice cut the air in the room sharper than a knife. ""Someone kidnapped me and brought me here without my permission. I want answers. I want them now.""

""You're not going to get that by yelling and making everyone nervous,"" John said, looking from Mary to Mason. ""Let's calm down and analyze what we know.""

Tracy was almost convinced John was a cop because of the way he was trying to calm Mason and Mary's nerves. He was the only one who looked composed and under control.

Suddenly, an unpleasant thought appeared in her mind. How can he be calm in this situation? They are all terrified, faced with an unimaginable situation while he is so irritatingly quiet. Who really is John? Did he have anything to do with their kidnappings?

Tracy felt another panic attack. Every face she looked at revealed new doubts. Who are these people around her? What connects them other than they are all from New Jersey? Are they part of an experiment?

""You look kind of strangely secretive, Tracy,"" it was more of a statement than a question from John. ""What do you do?""

Tracy looked back uneasily, feeling everyone's eyes on her now.

""Maybe it will help us discover why we are here if we find what connects us,"" Frank said soothingly.

""You mean, except that we all live in Jersey,"" Mason threw in as he dropped back to the floor.

Mary Crowley moved away from the door and, crossing her arms over her chest, stared at the ceiling, ignoring the others.

""Nothing special. I'm a nurse,"" Tracy muttered loudly, trying to keep her voice calm.

""I'm a retired history professor,"" Frank introduced himself indifferently.

""The head chef in the restaurant,"" said Olivia modestly.

""Software engineer,"" Mason said.

""Ex-cop, I work as a private investigator,"" John said briefly.

Mary ignored the others as if she were not involved in the whole situation.

""Now that we've established that, we know our jobs don't connect us. Do you agree with that, detective?"" Mason laughed again.

Before John could answer, Mary took a step closer to Mason.

""Are you amused by all this?"" she snapped sharply. ""Is this a game for you?""

John approached Mary and took her hand. Tracy instinctively stood up and moved closer to Frank.

Olivia was shaking, panic on her face.

""People, calm down. There's no need to create tension,"" she shouted, not knowing why she was interfering in the conflict. ""We're all in this together.""

Olivia's voice sounded like the croaking of a bird caught in a trap.

Mary tore herself from John's grip and went back to the corner of the room.

""If you have a hand in this, you'll be sorry. I promise you that,"" Mary's voice sounded menacing. ""There are people who will turn the whole Earth upside down to find me, and when that happens, those responsible for this will wish they had never met me.""

""Just keep telling yourself that,"" Mason said dismissively. ""No one will find us here. The sooner you come to terms with that fact, the easier it will be.""

""Maybe that's true for the likes of you, but not for me,"" Mary told him in disgust as Mason stood up again.

Tracy felt uneasy. Suddenly, she didn't know how to position herself. Mary seemed entirely antipathetic to her, John was too much of a mystery, Mason was a typical provocateur, Olivia was scared, and Frank was ordinary. Whom should she trust?

""Not all of us are destined to be presidents of big companies,"" Mason grinned. ""Some of us have to actually work to survive.""

""You don't know anything about me,"" said Mary. ""I don't know anything about you either. And to be completely honest, I don't even want to know.""

""This is Typical behavior of rich people. You're all the same. You look down on us ordinary people while you live in glass skyscrapers and watch real life lulled into your fairy tale world,"" Mason straightened the glasses on his nose. ""It's not hard for me to understand why someone would kidnap you.""

Mary shuddered at the outpouring of bitterness from Mason, who seemed about to get physical with her. His words made Frank and Olivia stand up and move closer to Tracy.

Tracy felt uncomfortable in a group with Frank and Olivia. It seemed the group had split into two factions, and she found herself in the weaker one. She glanced at Frank and was horrified to see him staring lazily at Olivia's exposed cleavage.

'Frank is a pervert,' flashed through her mind. She couldn't tear her eyes away from his face, which clearly showed lust. His lips were slightly parted, and saliva could be seen at the corners.

Unconsciously, she moved away from them, feeling completely isolated.

John stood very close to Mason, who continued to glare at Mary. She reciprocated in kind. The situation became increasingly tense, and the following silence only intensified it.

Tracy felt that one wrong word was enough to escalate everything into violence.

""You're not worth my time or attention,"" Mason finally said gruffly. ""None of you are worth it.""

He sat back on the floor and buried his head in his hands. John remained seated, waiting for Mary to move or acknowledge either.

Frank hugged Olivia, whispering words in her ear that only she could hear, causing them both to sit on the floor. Olivia rested her head on Frank's shoulder, pulling her knees closer to her chest. Tracy's horror grew as Frank placed his right hand on Olivia's right leg, caressing her with a sickening smile of pleasure. Tracy suddenly couldn't catch her breath. All these people seemed awful to her, except for John. Or maybe not.

On the other hand, maybe he's even worse. Didn't he say he was an ex-cop? Why the 'ex'? What's the reason he's no longer in the police? Maybe he's violent or an alcoholic?

Her thoughts bombarded her with questions and possibilities, overwhelming her. She had to scream. She opened her mouth but couldn't make the sound. Her horror becomes even more significant when she realizes that the whole room is disappearing into the darkness.

","

""Tracy?"" a woman's worried voice echoed over her thoughts. ""Tracy, wake up. Everything is fine. You just had a bad dream. Open your eyes.""

She obeyed and opened her eyes. Olivia was leaning over her with a slightly concerned look. She wore a white doctor's coat, and John and Mason wore blue hospital uniforms.

Tracy looked around. She was tied to a hospital bed in a room devoid of furniture or anything else. Just white walls, a bed, and two openings in the roof covered with iron bars.","The darkness enveloped Tracy, swallowing her whole. She felt herself falling, her body weightless, as if she were plummeting into an abyss. Her mind raced, trying to grasp onto any semblance of reality, but it was slipping away like sand through her fingers.

Suddenly, she landed with a jolt, her eyes snapping open. She was no longer in the dimly lit room with the others. Instead, she found herself in a brightly lit, sterile environment. The walls were white, and the air was filled with the faint scent of antiseptic. She was lying on a hospital bed, her body covered in sensors and wires.

A figure in a white lab coat approached her, a kind smile on his face. ""Welcome back, Tracy,"" he said gently. ""You've been through quite an ordeal.""

Tracy's mind struggled to process what was happening. ""Where am I? What happened to the others?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

The man pulled up a chair and sat beside her bed. ""You're in a research facility. You've been part of an experimental study on the effects of isolation and group dynamics under stress. The people you met were all actors, part of the simulation.""

Tracy's heart pounded in her chest. ""A simulation? But it felt so real.""

The man nodded. ""That's the point. We needed to create a realistic environment to study how individuals react in extreme situations. Your responses were invaluable to our research.""

Tracy's mind reeled. ""But why me? Why put me through this?""

The man sighed. ""You volunteered for this study, Tracy. You signed up to help us understand human behavior better. We ensured you were fully informed before you agreed.""

Tracy's memories began to resurface. She remembered signing the consent forms, the briefings, and the promise of a substantial financial reward. She had agreed to this, but the experience had been so immersive that she had forgotten.

As the reality of her situation sank in, Tracy felt a mix of relief and anger. She had been part of an elaborate experiment, but she had also learned something profound about herself and human nature.

The man stood up, offering her a reassuring smile. ""Take your time to recover. We'll debrief you fully once you're ready.""

Tracy lay back on the bed, her mind racing with the implications of what she had just experienced. The mystery had been solved, but the answers were far more surprising than she could have ever imagined.","<brainstorm>
1. **Simulation Experiment**: The characters are part of a psychological experiment or simulation to study human behavior under stress. The twist could be that Tracy is actually a researcher who volunteered to be part of the experiment but had her memory temporarily erased.
2. **Revenge Plot**: One of the characters orchestrated the kidnapping as a form of revenge. The twist could be that Mary Crowley is the mastermind, seeking revenge on the others for a past wrong.
3. **Shared Past**: The characters share a hidden connection from their past. The twist could be that they were all involved in a tragic event years ago, and someone is seeking justice or closure.
4. **Supernatural Element**: The room and the situation are part of a supernatural or otherworldly test. The twist could be that they are in purgatory or a similar realm, being judged for their past actions.
5. **Corporate Conspiracy**: The characters are all connected through a corporate conspiracy. The twist could be that Crowley Industries is behind the kidnapping, and Mary is there to observe their reactions.

Best Idea: **Shared Past** - The characters share a hidden connection from their past. The twist will be that they were all involved in a tragic event years ago, and someone is seeking justice or closure. This idea provides a strong emotional payoff and recontextualizes their interactions and tensions throughout the story.

<ending>
As the darkness enveloped the room, Tracy's mind raced, piecing together fragments of memories that had been buried deep within her subconscious. Suddenly, a flood of images and emotions surged through her, revealing a connection she had long forgotten.

Years ago, Tracy had been a nurse at a small hospital in New Jersey. One fateful night, a tragic accident had brought a group of people together in the emergency room. A young boy, the son of a prominent businessman, had been critically injured in a hit-and-run. Despite their best efforts, the medical team couldn't save him. The boy's father, devastated by the loss, had vowed to find those responsible and make them pay.

Tracy's eyes widened as she realized the truth. The people in the room with her were all connected to that night. John had been the police officer who investigated the case, Frank the history professor who had been driving the car, Olivia the waitress who had witnessed the accident, Mason the software engineer who had hacked into the hospital's records to cover up the incident, and Mary Crowley—the boy's mother.

Mary's cold demeanor and determination to find answers suddenly made sense. She had orchestrated this entire scenario to confront those she held responsible for her son's death. The room, the tension, the fear—it was all part of her plan to force them to face their past and seek justice.

Tracy's heart pounded as she looked at Mary, who now stood with a steely resolve. ""You did this,"" Tracy whispered, her voice trembling. ""You brought us here to make us pay for what happened to your son.""

Mary's eyes glistened with unshed tears as she nodded. ""I needed to know the truth, to see if any of you felt remorse for what you did. My son deserved justice.""

The room fell silent as the weight of their shared past settled over them. Each person grappled with their own guilt and regret, realizing that they were all bound by a tragic event that had changed their lives forever.

In that moment, Tracy understood that their only way out was to confront their past and seek forgiveness. ""We're sorry,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""We never meant for any of this to happen.""

Mary's expression softened, and she took a deep breath. ""Maybe now we can all find some semblance of peace.""

As the room slowly brightened, the characters felt a sense of closure wash over them. They had been brought together by tragedy, but perhaps now, they could begin to heal and move forward.

The door creaked open, and they stepped out into the light, leaving behind the darkness of their shared past.

The door creaked open, and they stepped out into the light, leaving behind the darkness of their shared past.
","Tracy's vision blurred as the room seemed to dissolve into an inky void. Her heart pounded in her chest, and she felt a wave of dizziness wash over her. She tried to focus on the faces around her, but they too were fading, becoming indistinct shadows in the encroaching darkness.

""What's happening?"" she managed to whisper, her voice trembling.

John's figure loomed closer, his face a mask of concern. ""Stay calm, Tracy. We're going to get through this.""

But his words felt hollow, and Tracy's panic only grew. She felt a sudden, sharp pain in her head, and the world around her spun violently. She closed her eyes, trying to steady herself, but the sensation of falling was overwhelming.

When she opened her eyes again, she was no longer in the dimly lit room. Instead, she found herself in a sterile, brightly lit laboratory. The cold, clinical environment was a stark contrast to the musty, oppressive room she had just been in. She was lying on a metal table, her wrists and ankles strapped down.

A figure in a white lab coat stood over her, adjusting a series of monitors and instruments. The figure turned, revealing a familiar face—Mary Crowley.

""Welcome back, Tracy,"" Mary said, her voice devoid of the arrogance and hostility it had held before. ""I see the simulation was quite effective.""

Tracy's mind reeled. ""Simulation? What are you talking about?""

Mary smiled, a cold, clinical smile. ""You and the others were part of an experiment. A psychological study to observe how individuals from different backgrounds and professions react under extreme stress and isolation. The room, the other participants—it was all a carefully controlled environment.""

Tracy's heart raced as she struggled to comprehend what Mary was saying. ""But why? Why put us through this?""

Mary's expression softened slightly. ""The study is part of a larger project to understand human behavior in crisis situations. The data we gather will help improve training for emergency responders, military personnel, and others who face high-stress environments.""

Tracy's mind raced, trying to process the information. ""And the others? John, Mason, Frank, Olivia—were they real?""

Mary nodded. ""They were real, but their roles were part of the simulation. Each of them was selected for their specific traits and backgrounds to create a diverse group dynamic. They were debriefed and released once their part in the study was complete.""

Tracy felt a mix of relief and anger. ""So, this was all just a game to you? A way to collect data?""

Mary's expression hardened. ""It was not a game, Tracy. It was a necessary experiment to gather valuable insights. Your participation will contribute to important advancements in our understanding of human behavior.""

Tracy's anger flared. ""You had no right to do this to us. To manipulate us like this.""

Mary sighed. ""I understand your anger, but you signed the consent forms. You agreed to participate in this study.""

Tracy's mind flashed back to the vague, innocuous forms she had signed months ago, never imagining they would lead to this. She felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.

Mary stepped back, signaling to a technician to release Tracy from the restraints. ""You are free to go, Tracy. A car will take you home. You will receive compensation for your time and participation.""

As Tracy sat up, rubbing her wrists where the straps had been, she felt a deep sense of betrayal. She had been a pawn in someone else's game, her emotions and fears manipulated for the sake of research.

As she walked out of the lab, the cold, clinical environment fading behind her, she vowed never to trust so easily again. The world outside seemed both familiar and alien, and she knew she would never see it the same way again."," Tracy's eyes slowly adjusted to her surroundings as she realized where she was. Her heart raced; confusion mixed with relief flooded through her. She tried to sit up but found herself restrained by a straightjacket, rendering her movements limited. The room was stark and cold, the air carrying a sterile chill that matched Tracy's growing unease.

Olivia stepped back, giving her space while she struggled against the jacket. ""You're in one of our secure observation wards,"" Olivia explained gently, trying to calm Tracy down. ""I know it looks intimidating, but you haven't been taken from your home; this is just a precaution.""

""Secure observation ward?"" Tracy echoed incredulously. She looked at John and Mason, who were busy attending to another patient in the room - an older man with disheveled hair that reminded her of Frank's lazy gaze. The memory of Olivia's intimate encounter with Frank haunted her, but now they seemed distant and unimportant compared to the pressing questions at hand.

""Why am I here?"" Tracy asked hoarsely as she attempted to pull herself up slightly on all fours despite her restraints. She felt disoriented, trying to piece together fragments of the nightmare that had just consumed her thoughts and emotions. The others in the room - John, Mason, Olivia, Frank – they were strangers again, but their presence was a lifeline in this bewildering situation.

John moved closer with an earnest expression on his face. ""We found you wandering outside unconscious, Tracy,"" he explained, his voice steady and reassuring. He held out the wristband from her hand, revealing her name, date of birth, and medical information - all scrawled hastily in black marker.

Tracy's mind raced with questions about why she was tied up like a prisoner or an experimental subject, but there were no answers yet. Just more fear than before, though it had shifted from the claustrophobic nightmare to her current reality. 

""What is this place?"" Tracy asked in desperation, her voice echoing off the barren walls of the room. Her gaze fell on Olivia again. She looked less like a doctor now; there was an element of sadness in her eyes that hadn't been there before. 

""It's a psychiatric ward,"" Mason admitted, his voice gruff but with an undercurrent of remorse. ""You were brought here for observation after you experienced severe trauma."" He looked at John expectantly as if seeking validation or approval from him.

John nodded, offering Tracy a reassuring smile. His eyes held sincerity that belied his former role as an 'ex-cop'. 

""We're going to get you untied and settled properly,"" Olivia said gently, reaching out to touch Tracy’s shoulder lightly before she left the room with John in her wake. 

As they exited the room, Tracy was filled with a mix of apprehension and hope. The nightmare may have been over for now but understanding why it happened – where this all took place - began to dawn on her like the sunrise after a long dark night.","f h p z"

“BACKSTABBER” HAS HOLLY HILL POLICE BAFFLED

Holly Hill- The sleepy Ohio River town of Holly Hill, Kentucky has never experienced anything like this.

“Look, usually, the only crime is somebody stealing a car or underage drinking. Never anything like this,” admits Holly Hill Police Chief Bob Scanlon.

“This” is a full blown serial killer, somebody locals have dubbed “Backstabber”. The only connection these murders seem to have is that all three victims died from stab wounds to the back. Forensics indicate that the murder weapon was probably a hunting knife of some sort.

The first killing took place on Friday, April 2. Alice Dalheim, 78, a retired schoolteacher was found lying face first in her back yard by a neighbor who spotted the corpse as he was taking out his garbage.

A little over a week later, on April 10, Rev. Odell Biggins, 46, Pastor of the Holy Ghost Chapel in Holly Hill, was found dead in the alley next to his church. Rev. Biggins’ congregation meets in a storefront that formerly housed Loretta’s Donut Shop. Biggins is probably best known for being an All State high school basketball player who played for the University of Louisville briefly.

“Just a great guy,” Cheif Scanlon said of Biggins. “I was the big football star around here and he was the big basketball star. We both got in some trouble when we tried playing college ball, but thank God, we turned it around and turned out to do alright.”

The most recent victim was Sherry Meadows, 20, a student at Morehead State University. Sherry was home on her spring break when she was killed. Her body was found in the yard of an abandoned house on River Road on the outskirts of Holly Hill by several young people who were reportedly having a party in the house.

“Nobody ain’t lived there for 25 years,” Chief Scanlon explained. Most little towns have a place like that. Nobody lives there and kids use it as a place to party. When one of my officers catches them in there, we run them out, of course. The night Sherry was found, she had been in there partying with a bunch of guys. One of them realized he hadn’t seen her for awhile, went outside to look for her and there she was.”

Cheif Scanlon stated that there was no real connection between the victims and it was only an assumption at this time that they were all victims of the same killer.

“They were all stabbed multiple times in the back and the murder weapon was evidently a hunting knife. That’s all we’ve really got at this point.”

A 9:30 curfew is being enforced in Holly Hill. Scanlon asks that anybody with information please contact the Holly Hill Police Department.

Scanlon’s picture is there, too. His muscle from his football glory days has gone to flab and he looks as pompous as ever in his cop outfit.

What a worthless sack of crap he is and always was. Yeah, he’s about 7 or 8 years older than me. He was indeed a star defensive end back in the day. He went off to Liberty University, Jerry Falwell’s school and got two or three cheerleaders pregnant before his first semester was over. That it was it for the great Bobby Scanlon. Back in high school, he was a big time FCA guy and gave his testimony at every revival meeting in the county. Mom always taled about what a “nice Christian boy” he was.

I found out what a fine Christian he was one Friday evening in Summer when I was 12 or 13. I went fishing with my friend, Denny Schultz, the only real friend I ever had. We spotted a car parked not far from our best fishing spot and went over to make sure it wasn’t some weirdo. In the back seat of the car, we spotted Bob Scanlon and Delilah, a local gal who was the paid female companionship for any Holly Hill resident who could come up with 20 bucks and a half hour. Let’s just say that old Bobby wasn’t exactly leading her to the Lord!

I haven’t had any use for so called “Christian athletes” ever since.

His police work is almost as good as anything else he’s ever tried. There is a connection between the three so called “victims”-they all deserved what they got.

Alice Dalheim was my English teacher in my first two years of high school. She singled me out for persecution and humiliation. In Freshman English, she assigned Silas Marner. That book has been banned from prison libraries as cruel and unusual punishment. I read about 15 or 20 pages and that was all that I could stand!

When the test rolled around, I guessed at the multiple choice and true/false questions. There was no guessing on the essay questions. I just wrote down whatever nonsense that popped into my head. Needles to say, I failed the test.

That was enough for the wicked witch. She made me get up in front of the class and read my answers to the essay questions! There I stood in my faded denim overalls from Goodwill and my knockoff Chuck Taylor tennis shoes from the dollar store. She laughed at me and the whole class joined in with her. The only person in the room who didn’t ridicule me was Denny Schultz, the only real friend that I have ever had.

“Consider that you didn’t read the book, it wasn’t that bad,” Denny told me afterwards. What a pal!

Ms. Dalheim will never humiliate anybody else.

During my freshman year, Odell Biggins sat beside me in Algebra I. Whenever our teacher was at the chalkboard, showing us how to do a problem, Odell would punch me in the back of the head. Odell was already 6’4 and was known to be handy with his fists. I didn’t dare retaliate. Even if I had managed to fight back, I would have been in big trouble. Nobody laid a hand on basketball or football players. Coach Corkins would have made sure that the principal had thrown the book at me. Odell would have probably claimed it was racially motivated. Even though Coach Corkins used the “n word” as much as a preacher quotes the Bible, he would have gone along with that accusation. He liked the fact that the Holly Hill Generals were on their way to their first winning season in 35 years too much not to stand up for his star, regardless of skin color.

I swore that someday Odell would be sorry that he messed with me. When he got the basketball scholarship to U of L, I thought I would never be able to fulfill my promise. Turns out, he was kicked off the team and out of school two games into his freshman year. It seemed that Denny Crum didn’t like having a drug addict on the team. It turns out that the good reverend is sorry, after all.

Sherry Meadows never wronged me at all. She was unfortunate to be the daughter of Lea Meadows. Lea was the prettiest girl in my high school. I was smitten with her. If she had ignored me like the other girls did, Sherry would still be alive today.

Lea was a tease. She realized that I was enamored with her and used it to humiliate me. Once in study hall, he sat beside me, rubbed my leg, and started talking about how cute that she thought I was. She’d ask me how I felt about her. I was so engrossed in being close to her that I didn’t realize that several other girls and Bo, her boyfriend had gathered behind us. I started telling her that that I thought she was beautiful and that I dreamed about her at night. Her friends started giggling. Then, Bo pulled the chair out from under me and I made a crash landing on the floor. I honestly thought that I had a broken tailbone! While I was lying on the floor, Bo put his foot on my throat and told me that he’d kill me if I ever came around Lea again!

That day, I promised myself that one day, I would kill Bo and Lea. I never got the chance. During the first week of school during our senior year, Bo drove his truck into a telephone pole while driving to school. He died instantly. Leukemia killed Lea ten years ago.

Young Sherry died for the sins of her mother.

I already know who will be next. I have it planned out. And I know why this person must die.

In my senior year, I actually had a girlfriend. Her name was Della Bagby. She was short, chubby, and had curly brown hair. She also had a pretty smile. She wasn’t exactly a beauty queen, but she was sweet and she was also a great kisser. She was Denny’s sister’s best friend and my pal played matchmaker. The three months that we were together was the closest I came to being happy back then.

Of course, it had to end. Two weeks before Prom, Della came to me and announced that she was going to prom with Clint Overbow. Clint’s father was Cecil Overbow, the owner of Iron Hill Foundry. Most men in in Holly Hill were unemployed and feeding their families with government checks. The few who were employed, including my father, worked at the foundry. I was furious. I wanted nothing more than to fight Clint Overbow, a pretentious little jerk who thought he was better because he was better off.

I knew better than to rock that boat, though. Someday, Della would regret ruining what little happiness that I had.

Della won’t be my next target. I’d love to taker her down, but I have completely lost track of her. I’ve spent hours on the internet, trying to find her, but it seems that she’s fallen off the face of the earth.

Her little sister, Wanda is here in Holly Hill. She’s next. Like little Sherry, she’s related to the wrong gal.

I’ve been watching Wanda. She looks a lot like Della. She’s an LPN. She works six days a week at the Holly Hill Free Clinic over on Railroad Street. On Saturday nights, she gets off work at 10 p.m. She walks home to her apartment over on Daniel Boone Drive, the next street over. To get to Daniel Boone Drive, she has to cross the railroad tracks. A train passes right about the time she gets off. It’s always a long train. She usually doesn’t get across the tracks until around 10:12 or so. There’s a little shed on the other side of the tracks where kids wait for the school bus in bad weather. I can hide in there and grab her as she goes by.

The cops are usually all out on the county roads, looking for drunks, on Saturday nights. Chief Scanlon has hired a night knocker whose rounds take him over to Railroad Street, but this guy doesn’t go on duty until 11. Besides, night knockers are almost always wannabe cops who aren’t qualified. Nothing to worry about.

Saturday night finally has arrived. I’m in the bust stop shed, Uncle Clete’s hunting knife in my right hand. I glance at my watch. It’s 9:59. Almost time.

Before long, I hear the train as it rumbles down the tracks, headed South. I can’t resist peeking out. Trains have always fascinated me. When I was 19, I even convinced Denny to hop a freight with me. We stayed on as far as Ashland and hitch hiked home. Like I said, he was a real pal.

I don’t look out again until I don’t hear any more train noises. There she comes, Wanda Bagby. She’s wearing pink scrubs, carrying a large handbag, and walking slowly like her feet hurt.

I wait until she’s in front of the bus stop. Then, I jump out and grab her. I drag her towards the shed. As we move backward, one of her shoes comes off. She’s stronger than she looks and I have a hard time holding her with my left arm. I could just do the job out in the open, but why should I take chances?

","

Then, I hear the voice.

“Hey, stop that!” he yells and a flashlight shines in my face!

Dang it! It’s that night knocker! He’s early! That voice! He sounds like… No, surely not!

I release Wanda. She retrieves her shoe and runs into the shed.

I take a defensive position and make stabbing motions toward the light. Night knockers don’t carry firearms. If it comes to it, I can take care of this situation, quickly and easily.

The familiar voice speaks again.

“Ransom? Ransom O’Keefe, tell me it isn’t you, brother!”

I was right. That is my ol’ buddy! The night knocker is Denny Schultz!

“It’s me, Denny. It’s me!”

“Denny moves closer and moves the flashlight so it isn’t in my face.

“Dear Lord Jesus, please tell me it ain’t been you doing these killings.”

I don’t think he’s swearing. If I know Denny Schultz, that was a prayer. I’ve never lied to my friend and I ain’t starting now.

“Yeah, it was me, Den,” I say> my voice cracks like a kid going through puberty.

“Now, Ransom, I know that you won’t ever use that knife on me! We meant too much to each other growing up. Why don’t you just toss that thing away?”

He’s right, of course. I think about throwing my weapon onto the tracks, but he’ll need it as evidence. I toss it underhand and it lands a few feet in front of him.

“Look, I have to arrest you, Ranny,” he says. He sounds like he’s on the verge of tears.

“Go to it!” I say. He’s not the only one attempting to choke back his emotions.

“Pursuant to the Supreme Court ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to legal representation. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one may be provided for you. Do you understand these Constitutional rights?”

“Yes, I’m afraid I do.”

He has used a handkerchief to pick up the knife.

“Look, they don’t give me no handcuffs, brother. Can I trust you to walk in front of me to the jail and not run away.”

I sigh. “It’s all over, I won’t run.”

“You seem relieved,” he says.

“Yeah.” That is all I can think to say.

“Hey, Wanda,” he yells.

She steps out of the little shed. She’s been crying.

“Listen, Wanda,” Denny says, “Shanda Freeman is working at the station. I’ll send her down here to get you. She’ll drive you to the station. An officer will need to question you. OK?”

Wanda nods. Then, she speaks.

“You be careful, Dennis! He must be crazy!”

“Don’t worry,” Denny responds. “This old boy and me have been friends for a long time!”

I only hope that my friend gets a promotion out of this.","I finally get her inside the shed and slam the door shut. Wanda is whimpering, her eyes wide with terror. I raise the knife, ready to plunge it into her back, when suddenly, a blinding light floods the shed. I freeze, momentarily disoriented.

""Drop the knife!"" a voice booms. I turn to see Chief Scanlon standing in the doorway, his gun trained on me. Behind him, a squad car's lights flash red and blue.

How did he find me? I think, panic rising. I was so careful.

""Drop it, now!"" Scanlon repeats, his voice steady but urgent. I let the knife clatter to the floor, my mind racing.

""How did you know?"" I ask, my voice trembling with a mix of fear and rage.

Scanlon steps forward, his eyes never leaving mine. ""You think you're the only one who remembers high school?"" he says, his voice low. ""You think you're the only one who holds grudges?""

I stare at him, confused. What is he talking about?

""Remember Denny Schultz?"" Scanlon continues. ""Your 'only real friend'? He came to me a few weeks ago, said he was worried about you. Said you were acting strange, talking about the past too much.""

Denny? My mind reels. My best friend, my only ally, betrayed me?

""He's been feeding us information,"" Scanlon says, almost sympathetically. ""We knew you'd go after Wanda. We just didn't know when.""

I feel a cold, sinking sensation in my stomach. Denny, the one person I trusted, had been working with the police all along.

""Why?"" I manage to choke out, my voice barely a whisper.

Scanlon's eyes soften, just a bit. ""Because he cares about you, even if you don't see it. He didn't want you to ruin your life any more than you already have.""

As the handcuffs click around my wrists, I realize the bitter truth: the only real friend I ever had was the one who saved me from myself. And in that moment, I understand that the real backstabber was never Denny, or Scanlon, or even my high school tormentors.

It was me.","<brainstorm>
1. **Denny's Betrayal**: Denny Schultz, the protagonist's only friend, has been working with the police all along. He knew about the protagonist's plans and has been feeding information to Chief Scanlon.
2. **Wanda's Trap**: Wanda Bagby is not as innocent as she seems. She has been aware of the protagonist's stalking and has set a trap for him with the help of the police.
3. **Protagonist's Delusion**: The protagonist is actually suffering from severe delusions and hallucinations. The people he believes he has killed are still alive, and the police are closing in on him for other crimes.
4. **Chief Scanlon's Redemption**: Chief Scanlon, despite his flaws, has been diligently working on the case and has set up a sting operation to catch the protagonist in the act.
5. **The Real Killer**: The protagonist is not the real ""Backstabber."" The real killer is someone else entirely, and the protagonist is about to become the next victim.

Combining elements from these ideas, the best twist would be to reveal that Denny Schultz has been working with the police, and Wanda Bagby is part of a sting operation to catch the protagonist. This twist recontextualizes the protagonist's actions and provides a satisfying resolution.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
As I drag Wanda towards the shed, she suddenly stops struggling. Her body goes limp, and I feel a moment of triumph. But then, she turns her head slightly and whispers, ""It's over.""

Before I can react, blinding lights flood the area, and I hear the unmistakable sound of police sirens. I try to run, but strong hands grab me from behind and force me to the ground. I look up and see Chief Scanlon's flabby face, a smug grin plastered across it.

""Got you, you sick bastard,"" he says, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

I struggle, but it's no use. More officers appear, and they quickly handcuff me. As they haul me to my feet, I see Denny Schultz standing nearby, his face a mix of sadness and determination.

""Denny? What are you doing here?"" I shout, my mind racing.

Denny steps forward, his eyes meeting mine. ""I'm sorry, man. I had to do it. I couldn't let you keep hurting people.""

My mind reels. ""You... you betrayed me?""

Denny nods. ""I had to. You were out of control. I told Chief Scanlon everything.""

Chief Scanlon steps closer, his grin widening. ""Your friend here has been working with us for weeks. We knew you were the 'Backstabber,' and we set up this little sting operation to catch you in the act.""

Wanda, now free from my grasp, walks over to Denny and gives him a grateful hug. ""Thank you, Denny. You saved my life.""

I feel a cold dread settle in my stomach. Everything I thought I knew, everything I planned, has crumbled around me. As the officers lead me away, I realize that my quest for revenge has only led to my own downfall.

In the end, it wasn't the ghosts of my past that destroyed me. It was the one person I thought I could trust.

As they shove me into the back of the police car, I catch one last glimpse of Denny. He looks back at me, his eyes filled with regret. ""I'm sorry,"" he mouths silently.

And then the door slams shut, sealing my fate.

The town of Holly Hill will finally have its peace, but at the cost of my twisted vendetta. The ""Backstabber"" is no more.

“Drop the knife!” a voice booms. It’s authoritative, commanding, and unmistakably familiar. I turn my head slightly and see Chief Scanlon standing there, his service revolver aimed directly at me. Behind him, a couple of other officers are fanning out, their guns also trained on me.

“Drop it, now!” Scanlon repeats, his voice steady but urgent.

I let the knife fall from my hand, and it clatters to the ground. Wanda collapses to her knees, sobbing and gasping for breath. Two officers rush forward, one to secure me and the other to help Wanda.

As they cuff me, Scanlon steps closer, his face a mix of anger and something else—pity, maybe? “You really thought you could get away with this, didn’t you?” he says, shaking his head.

I don’t respond. What’s the point? They’ve got me. It’s over.

As they lead me out of the shed, I see a figure standing in the shadows, just beyond the reach of the police lights. It’s Denny Schultz. He steps forward, his face a mask of sorrow and regret.

“Denny?” I manage to croak out, my voice barely audible.

He nods, his eyes meeting mine. “I’m sorry, man. I had to do it. I couldn’t let you go on like this.”

It hits me like a ton of bricks. Denny, my only real friend, had turned me in. He must have figured it out, pieced together the clues I thought I’d hidden so well. The betrayal stings, but deep down, I know he did the right thing. I was out of control, consumed by my need for revenge.

As they put me in the back of the squad car, I catch one last glimpse of Wanda being comforted by the officers. She’s safe, and for some reason, that brings me a strange sense of relief.

The car door slams shut, and as we drive away, I can’t help but think about the irony of it all. I had spent so much time planning my revenge, only to be undone by the one person I thought I could trust.

In the end, it wasn’t the police or my victims that brought me down. It was my own twisted sense of justice and the friend who cared enough to stop me before I went too far.

As the car speeds through the quiet streets of Holly Hill, I lean back and close my eyes. Maybe, just maybe, this is the ending I deserved all along.","

The young man had always been observant about Wanda Bagby's routine. He watched her from a distance as she walked home on Saturday nights, careful not to lose sight of her until he was certain it was safe. With meticulous planning and the passing of each second ticking by on his watch, which showed 9:58 pm, he prepared himself for what he believed was an inevitable encounter.

He could hear the distant humming of the train grow louder as it neared, its heavy wheels thundering across the tracks with rhythmic regularity—a soothing sound to him. A fascination had gripped him since youth; trains always held a certain allure for him.

When he finally saw her - Wanda Bagby- she was clad in pink scrubs, burdened by a large handbag and appearing as if her feet were protesting against the day's workload. He waited patiently until she approached the bus stop. Only then did he emerge from his hiding spot to confront her.","h z f p"
"15",15," De Nachtwacht ",15,445,"3/18/2024","Breaking News – Missing figures from Rijksmuseum
Reporter Daan Stamp
Reporting for Amsterdam Gazette

The world and this reporter are shocked to the core, with the breaking news announcement that certain figures are missing from the Rijksmuseum world famous collection. The Director of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam’s famous building and collection of precious masterpieces of art, Mevrouw Lembrandt, stood on the front steps of the building after calling upon the world’s press to make this groundbreaking news announcement today, this morning at 10:00, Amsterdam time.

Quoting Mrv. Lembrandt (no relation to our national hero Rembrandt van Rijn.) “We have discovered in the last twenty-four hours, that there are figures, and self-portrait figures missing from the museum’s masterpiece collection, for example, “De Nachtwacht” we have discovered; is missing characters, the central figures of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq (dressed in black with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow with a white sash). These figures are no longer present in the masterpiece – they are missing. We have also discovered that the self-portrait by Jan Havicksz Steen is missing from the piece of art. We have started an exhaustive investigation and are cooperating with the local police, and we are reaching out to the greater international policing and security community for assistance with this investigation.

“I would like to make it clear that the painting and framework are in place, only the figures are missing. The museum is now conducting an intensive audit of all the paintings and artwork of the Rijksmuseum on the premises, to understand if there are more, additional missing characters, yet to be discovered.”

“If anyone of the public has any knowledge or understanding of the whereabouts of these characters, would they kindly come forward to the police to share this information, and it will be handled in the strictest of confidence.”

“We thank you all for your understanding, but I cannot take any questions at this time, as I am urgently required now to continue this urgent investigation. I hope I have your cooperation and understanding.”

Like most people listening in the audience, this is shuddering news for the world. So many unanswered questions, such a sad moment for the world of art. How will this affect our famous and proud Rijksmuseum? If Rembrandt van Rijn and Jan Havicksz Steen were alive today, what would they be thinking? This is disastrous news for the world; could it be a signal from God, the day of reckoning is coming shortly, this reporter doesn’t have any answers, and hopes these missing characters can be found sooner rather than later.

Keep watching this space for further updates.

************************************************************

“Well, what have you found, Detective Inspector.” Mrv. Lembrandt said in an efficient manner, the moment she entered the room, coming directly from the press announcement.

If you had never met Mrv. Lembrandt, you would believe her efficient manner was provoked by the recent drama about the missing characters, but you would be mistaken – she was always the same, purposeful, energic, listen to me, type of person. She demanded attention. She was the type of person that no one should take her questions lightly, no one should take her avid attention idly. In her worlds, whether business or personal she ruled with authority, her life had purpose, every second of the waking day was dedicated to an activity, one would wonder if this powerhouse of a human being needed sleep, replacement batteries or a plug recharge occasionally were more suitable to the drive and appearance of this authoritarian, officious, purposeful Director of the Rijksmuseum.

Mrv. Lembrandt was tall in stature, with her neat and practical cropped blond hair, which shone brightly as she entered the room, reflecting the overhead ceiling lights, her appearance was sudden, although everybody was expected her appearance, there was a slightly shocked impression on the faces of all the people waiting in the meeting room, any conversion ceased abruptly, as all their eyes were suddenly focused upon the arrival of the Director.

Mrv. Lembrandt was born in Amsterdam, she hardly left the city in her entire life. Tall, stout woman, she always wore trousers, rode those “Mary Poppins” style bikes every day from her house in the canal district of Amsterdam to her employment at the Rijksmuseum. Her legs pumping the heavy machinery of the bike to maximum velocity, with her stout fell walkers’ legs her calves pumping the large pedals of the sky-blue coloured bike, with its voluminous basket, carrying her briefcase, ringing her bicycle bell impatiently at fellow peddlers, and lingering pedestrians unfamiliar with the city pathways, if the bicycle bell could talk, it would be saying “I’m coming through, out of my way!”

She most certainly was a stereotype of the city of Amsterdam, and probably was related to the long-ago 17th century civil defense militia named The Kloveniers which were a civic guard in Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age. Her tall profile and physique were a perfect fit for any type of defensive or security protection career. In her role as Director of the Rijksmuseum, she assumed the role of custodian of these masterpieces of art, she was the ultimate protector of Amsterdam’s treasures, and she took her role very seriously. The objects in the building were precious to her, as the treasures in her small dwelling in the canal district of the city.

Director Lemsbrandt sat down at the head of the long oblong meeting room table. The vacant chair had been waiting for her arrival. The moment she sat down, there was the noiseless sound of the starting gun, GO.

“So, what have you discovered?” It was the obvious question, and anticipated by all in the room, waiting for Mrv. Lemsbrandt’s arrival.

“We want you to look at the CCTV tapes from the camera adjacent to the “De Nachtwacht” the night before last at 02:35am, Madam Director.” Said the Inspector.

There was a vast array of monitors, and the black and white image of the hall that accommodated the masterpiece “De Nachtwacht”, suddenly came into focus, at the bottom of the screen was the date and time, milliseconds, and seconds were ticking over, the vast scene at nighttime as the canvas was shown on the monitors. Nothing stirred, all was still, and then suddenly the characters of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch suddenly moved. They walked and moved to the right of the canvas, and disappeared from the canvas, the still image of the painting remained in full view.

Everybody in the room gasped in surprise, even those that had witnessed the CCTV footage already.

The detective inspector stood up, and went to screen, the video operator based on rehearsals of the presentation to the Director of the Rijksmuseum, rewound and then paused the video footage, as the two characters were exiting the canvas to the right.

“We can rule out Google Pixel Eraser.” The inspector said with dramatic undertone to the statement.

“We can rule out abduction, kidnapping, the gentlemen are leaving the canvas of their own freewill.”

“Plus, we have made a preliminary review of the CCTV footage of the self-portrait of Jan Havicksz Steen, and we can see around about the same time that he suddenly disappeared from the canvas. We are having the audio part of the tape analyzed, but our first impression indicates that he was not abducted, but we can hear men shouting off canvas, and the sound of bicycle bells ringing. We have requested an expert to confirm our analysis.”

“How can this be?” Blasted Mrv Lemsbrandt.

“These characters have remained like statues for 400 years, why do they abscond now? I need answers; Inspector, and I need answers quickly.” she demanded.

“We have some theories Madam Director!” The inspector replied, but he was not so confident to share his theories with the Rijksmuseum Director without her permission.

“Yes…” she invited to proceed, with a wave of hand in impatience and disrespect.

","

“We think the characters have gone on strike.” He smiled meekly after the words came out of his mouth.

“ON STRIKE!” Mrv Lemsbrandt blasted out.

The entire room cowered in reaction to her outburst of words.

“How can these characters go on strike, when they all engaged and paid the art master himself; Rembrandt van Rijn, a handsome sum of money for the privilege to be painted and become an international treasure forever. It is an impertinence to propose such a theory, Detective.” She scolded the Detective like one would a naughty child.

“The Captain and Lieutenant were upstanding citizens of the great city of Amsterdam, they led by example, and had civic duties for the protection of the city and its citizens, who dare you think that these fine upstanding people would consider an underhand and frivolous activity like striking. Impossible, and it makes you less in my opinion for considering this as an option.”

The scolding was over, but so was the audience and presentation to the Director, the Inspector’s findings, there was nothing more for the Inspector to discuss. The entire room, after the scolding by the Director, could not look him in the face, he was already standing, he gathered his belongings, and without another word and with a sheepish look on his face, left the meeting room.

As the door closed Mrv. Lemsbrandt leaned over to her assistant, and spoke in a low whispering tone, so that no other person in the room could hear.

“Get down to Tweede Kamer Café on Singel, and see if anybody has seen these three, get the word out in the wacky-backy café district, strike indeed, it’s more likely they needed some weed time, with a double espresso. Go now!”

After her assistant followed the inspector out of the meeting room door, she turned her full attention to the remaining people in the room.

“Luuk please call Monsieur Chevalier of the Louvre immediately, and tell him what has happened here, tell him to check on the whereabouts of Mona Lisa, this could be a global pandemic, we can never be too sure.”

Luuk made an appreciative display of writing down Madam Director instructions, and then he departed the meeting room.

Mrv Lemsbrandt sighed, and then shared her thoughts with the remaining attentive audience.

“What is this world coming to IF you can’t rely on the characters, the subjects in a masterpiece painting. Art is a serious business – don’t they understand. Why now? For decades they have been still life, and now they abscond. I will get to the bottom of this, and it will STOP!”

Everybody in the room nodded in solemn agreement.","The inspector cleared his throat, his eyes darting nervously around the room. ""Madam Director, we believe the characters may have left the paintings due to a phenomenon we are currently investigating. It appears to be linked to a specific artifact recently acquired by the museum.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's eyes narrowed. ""What artifact?""

The inspector hesitated, then continued, ""A 17th-century mirror, rumored to have mystical properties. It was part of a private collection and was donated to the museum last month. We believe it might have something to do with the characters' sudden departure.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's face turned a shade paler. ""Where is this mirror now?""

""In the storage room, awaiting restoration,"" the inspector replied.

""Take me there,"" she commanded, rising from her chair with a sense of urgency.

The group moved swiftly through the museum's corridors, their footsteps echoing ominously. They reached the storage room, and the inspector unlocked the door. Inside, amidst various artifacts, stood an ornate, full-length mirror with an intricately carved frame.

Mrv. Lembrandt approached the mirror cautiously. ""What do you know about this mirror?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The inspector replied, ""Legend has it that the mirror can act as a portal, allowing those depicted in paintings to step out into the real world. But it's just a legend, of course.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's reflection in the mirror seemed to shimmer and distort. She reached out a hand, almost involuntarily, and touched the glass. Suddenly, the room was filled with a blinding light.

When the light faded, the inspector and the others were stunned to see that Mrv. Lembrandt was no longer in the room. Instead, her reflection remained in the mirror, looking out at them with a mixture of surprise and resignation.

The inspector stepped forward, his face pale. ""Madam Director?"" he called out, but there was no response.

As they stared at the mirror, the reflection of Mrv. Lembrandt began to move, walking away from the glass and disappearing into the depths of the mirror's world. The inspector turned to his team, his voice trembling. ""It seems the mirror's legend is true. The characters didn't just leave the paintings—they were drawn into another realm. And now, so has Mrv. Lembrandt.""

The room fell silent, the weight of the revelation sinking in. The inspector knew they had to find a way to retrieve the missing characters—and their director—from the mysterious world within the mirror. But how? The answer, it seemed, lay hidden in the depths of the mirror's ancient secrets.","<brainstorm>
1. The characters are leaving the paintings because they are being summoned by a higher power or force, possibly related to an ancient curse or spell.
2. The characters are leaving the paintings to protect something or someone, possibly the museum itself or a hidden treasure within it.
3. The characters are leaving the paintings because they are being called to a secret meeting of historical figures to prevent a disaster.
4. The characters are leaving the paintings because they are tired of being confined and have found a way to escape.
5. The characters are leaving the paintings because they are being manipulated by a modern-day art thief who has discovered a way to control them.

Best Idea: The characters are leaving the paintings because they are being summoned by a higher power related to an ancient curse. This twist will recontextualize the earlier events and provide a surprising yet logical explanation for the characters' disappearance.

The inspector cleared his throat, gathering his thoughts before continuing. ""Madam Director, our preliminary investigation has led us to an ancient manuscript recently acquired by the museum. It was found in the archives, hidden within the pages of an old ledger. The manuscript details a curse placed upon certain paintings by a 17th-century alchemist named Cornelius van der Meer.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's eyes narrowed. ""A curse? This is preposterous.""

""Please, hear me out,"" the inspector urged. ""According to the manuscript, van der Meer was a contemporary of Rembrandt and other great artists of the Dutch Golden Age. He believed that the essence of the subjects in these paintings could be bound to the canvas, but only for a limited time. The curse was designed to protect the paintings from being stolen or damaged. If the paintings were ever in danger, the characters would come to life and leave the canvas to safeguard their legacy.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's stern expression softened slightly as she considered the possibility. ""So, you're saying that the characters left the paintings because they sensed some form of danger?""

""Precisely,"" the inspector replied. ""We believe that the recent renovations in the museum may have inadvertently triggered the curse. The vibrations from the construction work could have been interpreted as a threat by the characters.""

""But where have they gone?"" Mrv. Lembrandt asked, her voice tinged with frustration.

""We have a lead,"" the inspector said, pointing to the paused CCTV footage. ""Notice the direction they are heading. It aligns with the location of the museum's oldest and most secure vault. We believe they are gathering there to protect something of immense value.""

Mrv. Lembrandt stood up, her resolve renewed. ""Then we must go there immediately.""

The group hurried through the museum's corridors, descending into the depths of the building. As they approached the vault, they heard faint voices and the unmistakable sound of bicycle bells ringing. The inspector carefully unlocked the heavy door, and they stepped inside.

To their astonishment, they found Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch, and Jan Havicksz Steen standing guard around a small, ornate chest. The characters turned to face the newcomers, their expressions stern but not hostile.

Mrv. Lembrandt approached cautiously. ""What is in the chest?"" she asked.

Captain Cocq stepped forward, his voice echoing with authority. ""This chest contains the true essence of the Dutch Golden Age, a collection of artifacts and documents that hold the secrets of our time. We have protected it for centuries, and we will continue to do so.""

Mrv. Lembrandt nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. ""Thank you for your vigilance. We will ensure that the chest remains safe.""

With a nod of approval, the characters began to fade, returning to their respective canvases. The inspector and Mrv. Lembrandt watched in awe as the figures reappeared in their paintings, their mission complete.

As they left the vault, Mrv. Lembrandt turned to the inspector. ""We must ensure that the museum's renovations do not disturb the paintings again. The legacy of our history depends on it.""

The inspector agreed, and together they set out to protect the treasures of the Rijksmuseum, knowing that the characters within the paintings would always be watching over them.

The inspector agreed, and together they set out to protect the treasures of the Rijksmuseum, knowing that the characters within the paintings would always be watching over them.

","The inspector cleared his throat, visibly nervous under the intense gaze of Mrv. Lembrandt. ""Well, Madam Director, we have consulted with several experts in art history, physics, and even some more... unconventional fields. One theory that has emerged is that the characters might be responding to some sort of external stimulus, perhaps a frequency or a signal that we are not yet aware of.""

Mrv. Lembrandt's eyes narrowed. ""A signal? Are you suggesting that these figures are somehow alive?""

""Not alive in the traditional sense, Madam Director,"" the inspector replied cautiously. ""But perhaps imbued with some form of energy or consciousness that we do not yet understand. We have also consulted with a renowned physicist, Dr. Van der Meer, who specializes in quantum mechanics. He suggested that the paintings might be acting as portals or gateways to another dimension.""

""Portals? Gateways?"" Mrv. Lembrandt's voice was a mix of incredulity and frustration. ""This is not a science fiction novel, Inspector. I need concrete answers.""

""Yes, Madam Director, I understand,"" the inspector said, trying to maintain his composure. ""But Dr. Van der Meer's theory is not without merit. He believes that the recent renovations in the museum, particularly the installation of new LED lighting, might have inadvertently triggered this phenomenon. The specific wavelength of the new lights could be interacting with the pigments in the paintings in a way that we do not yet comprehend.""

Mrv. Lembrandt sat back in her chair, her mind racing. ""So, you're telling me that our new lighting system is causing 17th-century figures to walk out of their paintings?""

""Essentially, yes,"" the inspector replied. ""We have already started testing this theory by reverting to the old lighting system in some sections of the museum. Early results are promising; the figures in those paintings have remained static.""

Before Mrv. Lembrandt could respond, the door to the meeting room burst open, and a young technician rushed in, holding a tablet. ""Madam Director, Inspector, you need to see this,"" he said, breathless.

The technician placed the tablet on the table and played a video. It was a live feed from one of the museum's lesser-known galleries. The painting in question was a serene landscape by Jacob van Ruisdael. As they watched, a small figure—a shepherd—stepped out of the painting, looked around, and then walked back into the canvas.

Mrv. Lembrandt's face turned pale. ""This is happening all over the museum?""

""Yes, Madam Director,"" the technician confirmed. ""And it's not just the Rijksmuseum. We've received reports from other museums around the world. The Louvre, the Prado, the National Gallery—all experiencing similar phenomena.""

The room fell silent as the gravity of the situation sank in. Mrv. Lembrandt took a deep breath, her mind racing with the implications. ""We need to shut down the museum immediately and revert all lighting systems to their previous state. And we need to coordinate with other museums to do the same.""

As the team sprang into action, Mrv. Lembrandt couldn't shake the feeling that they were on the brink of discovering something monumental. The art world would never be the same again. And as she watched the figures on the screen, she couldn't help but wonder: What if these characters had always been more than just paint and canvas? What if they had been waiting for the right moment to step into our world?

The inspector's voice broke her reverie. ""Madam Director, there's one more thing. Dr. Van der Meer believes that if we can understand the exact conditions that triggered this phenomenon, we might be able to control it. Imagine the possibilities—interacting with historical figures, learning from them directly.""

Mrv. Lembrandt nodded slowly, her mind already racing with the potential. ""Let's focus on containment first, Inspector. But keep Dr. Van der Meer on standby. We may need his expertise sooner than we think.""

As she left the room, the weight of the situation pressing down on her, Mrv. Lembrandt couldn't help but feel a strange sense of excitement. The world of art was on the cusp of a new era, and she was at the helm."," As Madam Director Lemsbrandt hung up her phone after a lengthy conversation with Monsieur Chevalier from the Louvre about Mona Lisa's safety, she couldn’t help but marvel at the absurdity that had unfolded before her eyes: characters in masterpieces coming to life. Yet there was no time for laughter - this incident could have potentially disastrous implications on the art world.

As days turned into weeks, Lemsbrandt spearheaded a specialized team of experts from various disciplines — historians, cryptologists, and quantum physicists included. They worked tirelessly to understand what led to this unprecedented occurrence: the painting characters going ""on strike.""

Soon enough they discovered that an underground art syndicate was behind the unusual phenomenon. These thieves had somehow accessed a long-lost technology capable of manipulating quantum particles, causing these paintings' subjects to temporarily leap off canvas and into reality. Their plan? To demand better conditions for their ""striking"" counterparts by leveraging this newfound power.

Mrv Lemsbrandt was relentless in her pursuit; she knew that the art world must remain intact, unharmed from such threats. In a daring operation involving international law enforcement agencies and covert negotiations with the syndicate's leaders, Director Lemsbrandt led an assault on their secret lair hidden beneath Amsterdam’s catacombs.

Inside, amidst countless stolen art pieces from around the world, they found a high-tech control room filled with quantum computers and equipment that could manipulate reality at a subatomic level. After hours of tense negotiations and clever distractions by the Rijksmuseum's own curators who had temporarily taken the form of their painted characters to keep an eye on the thieves, Lemsbrandt managed to shut down the machines and restore order in both worlds—real and painted.

With the syndicate members apprehended and the technology destroyed, peace was restored to art galleries globally. The painting characters returned to their rightful places among their masterpieces, much to the relief of everyone involved. 

But Lemsbrandt's mind churned with more questions: How could they prevent this from happening again? What other secrets lay buried within history and art that she was yet to uncover? As her eyes scanned over a restored Rembrandt, now safely back in his frame, a determined spark flared within her. 

""The world of art is under threat,"" Lemsbrandt mused. ""But we must stand up for our own strike."" Her resolve hardened as she pledged to protect the very essence of creativity and expression that had been challenged by this incident, ensuring such an event would never disrupt the harmony between art enthusiasts and their beloved masterpieces again.","z f p h"

Uncle Teddy didn’t talk much and he didn’t drink at all anymore, so he tended to fade into the background at family holiday celebrations. This was in contrast to Aunt Loraine, who was a talker, and an enthusiastic consumer of specialty cocktails. These are both family traits. We all love to talk and poke fun at each other, and family gatherings can sometimes get very loud as everyone is trying to be heard. We also make alcohol front and center on these occasions, and we have numerous family recipes for punches, blender drinks, and infused vodka. In the spring, for example, my dad likes to make his special lemon blueberry daiquiris, and we like to drink them to mark the season. In the summer, it’s Cousin Mary’s strawberry mojitos, in the autumn it’s our family whiskey-rum punch recipe that has been passed down for generations, and in December it’s apple martinis with cranberry infused vodka, Aunt Loraine’s own invention.

At holiday parties her martini-fueled conversation always became more and more passionate and her laugh became louder, and she started joke-insulting people and jabbing her manicured fingers at them. On those occasions, Uncle Teddy got more and more silent until you barely noticed he was in the room. On Christmas Eve that year, I literally sat next to him on the couch for two hours and couldn’t remember later if he’d been there at all. I must have been turned away from him talking to someone else. Figuratively speaking, Uncle Teddy disappeared.

Then overnight on New Year’s Eve, it became literal. The New Year’s Eve celebration was at Aunt Aurelia and Uncle Jim’s house. (Aurelia and Loraine were twin sisters.) We know Uncle Teddy was there until shortly after midnight, because there’s no way Aunt Loraine could have driven herself home. But the next morning, he was gone.

We didn’t know about it until we showed up at noon for New Year’s brunch at Teddy and Loraine’s house. She was cheerfully bustling around the kitchen, the table already set for a party. As we gratefully soothed our hangovers with her signature (vodka laced) champagne mimosas, the conversation took all the familiar turns, and Loraine’s cooking suffered some as she revived arguments from the evening before. Hoping to distract her, somebody finally thought to ask, “Where’s Uncle Teddy?”

Aunt Loraine’s face suddenly became serious, and in the tone of someone breaking the news that a friend has the flu, said, “Oh honey, he’s gone.”

There was just a beat of silent uncomprehending shock before everyone starting talking: What? What do you mean gone? Where did he go? Is he okay? What are you talking about, Loraine?

She waited a moment for the hubbub to die down before she said, “Well, Teddy raptured. He told me it was coming, the Lord told him. And last night he floated up and away.”

This time the silence was longer.

Uncle Jim said, gently, “Did you see him float away, Loraine? Did you actually see him rapture?”

If anything, Aunt Loraine looked amused. She wiped her hands on her apron and turned off the burners on the stove. “I’ll show you,” she said.

All dozen of us followed her up the stairs, drinks in hand as though she had offered to show us a beautiful view or a new piece of furniture. We all secretly believed we were about to find Uncle Teddy’s corpse, but their bed was neatly made with no one in it, the bathroom was fully visible with no one in it, and she opened the sliding doors onto the small balcony and gestured outside.

No Uncle Teddy, but a surprising scene. One of the folding chairs on the balcony had been tipped over and lay on its side. Uncle Teddy’s brown orthopedic shoes were sitting by a neat pile of discarded clothing. I recognized the shirt he had worn last night, along with pants, socks, and old fashioned white cotton underwear.

“Teddy told me at Thanksgiving that the Lord told him he was going to rapture soon, and we’ve talked about it since. Then, this morning, when I got up he was gone, and (she gestured at the clothes on the deck) I knew it had happened.”

After a moment, into the silence she dropped one last remark. “You don’t need clothes in heaven.”

Brunch was an uncharacteristically silent experience. 

Part 2

We told ourselves that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation. Aunt Loraine was starting to be forgetful, after all, and maybe she just forgot where he went. The clothes on the balcony were puzzling, but could she have put them out herself? Why? Could she be a lot crazier than we thought? We talked a lot about that. My husband Jason suggested we hire a private detective to find out where Teddy had gone, but nobody wanted to tell anyone outside the family about it and his idea was shot down.

Days passed. The conversation turned from the idea that he just went away for a few days to the idea that something serious might have happened to him. Maybe Aunt Loraine wasn’t just forgetful, but actually psychotic? Could she have killed him in a drunken rage and somehow disposed of the body?

As farfetched as that idea was, it took hold. Josh asked to borrow her car, and she cheerfully and tipsily acquiesced. He drove it down the hill a couple blocks, then pulled over and checked the trunk. He went over the entire interior of the car with a strong flashlight and didn’t see bloodstains or in fact anything suspicious.

Then Jonny took his little boys over to Aunt Loraine’s house, and under the guise of playing catch, checked the whole backyard carefully to see if any soil had been disturbed. Nothing.

Weeks had passed. It was now the end of January.

Josh called to see if we could meet up at Uncle Jim & Aunt Aurelia’s. “We’ve got to figure out what happened to Teddy, we’ve got to strategize what to do.” It was true that there had been no word, no progress of any kind. My brothers, who had always used flattery to get me to do stuff I didn’t want to do, told me that I was Aunt Loraine’s favorite, and I should ask her about getting the police to look into it.

She wasn’t angry about it, she just looked at me in puzzlement. “What do you mean, dear? Didn’t I tell you he raptured?”

“But Aunt Loraine, should we maybe call the police anyway, just in case?”

She just laughed. “Oh, honey, do you think the police can find him in heaven?” She got a good chuckle out of that, and told a few relatives that I thought the city police could track down Teddy in heaven.

So we all gathered at Uncle Jim and Aunt Aurelia’s for a glass of wine on a Friday evening. “Should I whip up something in the blender?” asked Aunt Aurelia, concerned, but we all assured her that wine was just fine.

Still, the conversation veered and circled as usual, and there was a lot of loud talking, as usual, and in the end nobody convinced anybody of anything, as usual. 

Aunt Aurelia was of the opinion that Teddy really had raptured, and was now looking down on us from heaven. (She rolled her eyes upward and looked at the ceiling when she said this.) Others thought he had been kidnapped, but where was the ransom demand? Or that he had just disappeared, maybe with amnesia, but how was he living? 

Some of the cousins still thought Aunt Loraine might have killed him, and there was a lot of arguing about whether that was even possible. She walked with a cane, after all. She might have given him pills or hit him over the head with a baseball bat, but without a body, and without any idea of where she might have put it or how, it seemed like a vanishingly small possibility. My brothers thought he might have met a violent end in some other way, but how do you explain the clothes on the balcony?

Uncle Jim was the only one to not offer an opinion, and it took us a while to notice. He had been as close to Teddy as anyone; they had married twin sisters around the same time and their lives had been parallel ever since. But when someone finally asked him what he thought we should do, he blew up at us. Uncle Jim’s anger was so uncommon, everybody else actually shut up in surprise.

“Why can’t we just leave it alone?” he blurted out. “We don’t know what happened to him, you all think you know but you don’t. I’m sick and tired of this family!”

And he stormed out of the room.

That was a real conversation stopper.

The only thing that happened because of that meeting was that Jonny took his little boys over to play catch in Uncle Jim and Aunt Aurelia’s back yard, and kept an eye out for disturbed soil, but didn’t see anything.

Part 3

For the first few months, people kept seeing, or thinking they saw, Teddy. My brother Pete even chased down a look-alike on the street and almost scared the poor man to death. But after a lot of false alarms, we just let the idea of Uncle Teddy fade away. His name would come up from time to time, but if the question of his whereabouts was mentioned, it just led to a fight and nothing else.

Then, fifteen months and four days after Teddy had disappeared, Aunt Loraine died. She was only in her seventies, but she’d had diabetes and a heart condition for years. Hank found her when he went over to move her weekly trash out to the street. We all felt bad about it. She had been a real character, we told ourselves, a true one of a kind, a hard-partying lady who never slowed down. We conveniently forgot her angry, drunken phone calls and behavior that was sometimes a little too outrageous even for our family.

Her memorial service, at the church she had claimed but almost never went to, was pretty well attended. Our family is a large family, and everyone is always there for weddings and funerals. And there were some neighbors there, and a few people we didn’t know but were probably connected with the church. Aunt Aurelia arrived with Hank, saying that Jim would be right there.

","

And then, just before the service began, when the music had already started, in walked Uncle Jim, and by his side was Uncle Teddy. At that moment, the minister stood up behind the pulpit and began the service, so though there was a murmur from the family, nobody interrupted. Uncle Teddy nodded to us and gave us a wave, then sat down in the front row.

I’m sure whatever the minister had to say was very meaningful, but nobody in the family was paying any attention. We were all staring at the back of Uncle Teddy’s head and squeezing each others’ hands in shock and shooting meaningful glances at each other.

Afterward, he was of course mobbed by the family in the narthex. Uncle Jim waved us off. “Family, come up to our place now, we’ll talk there.”

I heard Aunt Aurelia apologizing to a church lady that we wouldn’t be there for their carefully laid out coffee and cookies. “The family has to be alone today,” she explained, and we all raced out of the church to our cars, leaving puzzled neighbors and church people to watch us scurry away.

At the house, there was almost no conversation. We gathered in the living room, sitting on the couches and leaning in the doorways, waiting for Uncle Teddy to speak. He cleared his throat and looked around the room. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I love you all, but when I realized I had to leave, that I couldn’t be with Loraine anymore, I asked Jim to help me disappear.”

Our heads swiveled to look accusingly at Uncle Jim. “You knew?” somebody said. Jim nodded. “You bet I helped him. A man deserves to make some decisions in his life. Teddy has been living here in our basement.”

We all looked at Aunt Aurelia. “Don’t look at me,” she said, “I’m as surprised as you are.”

“But Aunt Aurelia, in your own basement?”

“You know I can’t get down there anymore. Not for years.” She waved her cane to show she couldn’t manage the basement stairs.

Teddy said, “That part doesn’t matter. I’m just sorry if I hurt you or caused you to worry.”

“But Teddy, why?” asked my father.

“Loraine… had fine qualities,” responded Teddy. “She was a very beautiful woman when we were young, you know, a real head turner, as we used to say. And she was lively, a lot of fun. She was always up for a party, a weekend trip, an adventure. We had so much fun in those days.” He paused for a minute, remembering. “But time wasn’t kind to Loraine. The drinking was a bigger and bigger thing. I finally told her I thought we should both lay off the alcohol, and I actually did quit, but she just laughed at me when I suggested she quit too. And since I wasn’t drinking with her, I was noticing more things. She got to be difficult… mean. She said some pretty nasty things. She’d pass out, and since I couldn’t carry her upstairs anymore, I’d just leave her on the floor and put a pillow under her head and a blanket on top of her. But she still wouldn’t consider getting treatment or anything. And then there was the family, all of you, and all the drinking and the arguing, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I had to get away.”

Mary said, “You couldn’t just get a divorce?”

“I knew she’d be devastated, and I didn’t actually want to hurt her, just get away from her. And obviously I couldn’t just disappear and turn it into a big missing persons thing and cause her a lot of worry and distress. Also, they might have found me, and that would have been worse for her, so hurtful and mortifying to have her husband run away.”

We all processed that for a moment.

“So I had the rapture idea,” said Teddy. “Sometimes when she was drunk she’d call on Jesus to save her soul, and one of those times I told her I was talking to Jesus, too. Then I worked the conversation around to Jesus telling me I was going to rapture, and I’d see her in heaven, and it was pretty easy after that. I waited till I thought she was completely convinced, and then I just disappeared. Oh, of course I left the stuff on the balcony so she wouldn’t have any doubts. I knew she’d accept it and just go on with her life without having to go through all that grief.”

When he put it that way, it made a lot of sense. Everybody patted him on the back or hugged him or said, “Good to have you back.” Then Aurelia got out the blender and my dad whipped up a batch of blueberry lemon daiquiris, and we all lifted a glass to Aunt Loraine.

But Teddy’s story stuck with me, and Jason and I talked about it a lot the next day when we were sober again. He said it struck a nerve with him, and he knew exactly how Uncle Teddy had felt. “I hate the family parties too,” he said. “So much alcohol, the same old conversations over and over again. I just get tired of it.” Then, “I sometimes think I’d like to rapture too. I love you, but I hate the drinking.”

Long story short, we both quit the alcohol. So did my brothers and several cousins in our generation. And family celebrations were different, with a group of us not drinking. And in that group, Uncle Teddy was the life of the party.","The service was about to start when Uncle Jim finally walked in, looking more disheveled than usual. He took a seat in the back, avoiding eye contact with everyone. The pastor began with a prayer, and as he spoke, I noticed Uncle Jim fidgeting, his eyes darting around the room. Something was off.

After the service, we gathered at Aunt Aurelia’s house for a reception. The atmosphere was somber, but the usual family banter started to bubble up. I found myself standing next to Uncle Jim, who was nursing a glass of whiskey. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days.

“Uncle Jim, are you okay?” I asked, genuinely concerned.

He looked at me, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and guilt. “I need to tell you something,” he whispered, glancing around to make sure no one else was listening. “Meet me in the garage in five minutes.”

Curiosity and dread gnawed at me as I made my way to the garage. Uncle Jim was already there, pacing nervously. He closed the door behind me and took a deep breath.

“I can’t keep this secret any longer,” he said, his voice trembling. “Teddy didn’t rapture. He didn’t disappear. He’s been here all along.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my heart pounding.

Uncle Jim walked over to a large, dusty tarp in the corner of the garage. With a shaky hand, he pulled it back, revealing a hidden trapdoor in the floor. He opened it, and a musty smell wafted up. “Follow me,” he said, descending the ladder into the darkness.

I hesitated but followed him down. The basement was dimly lit, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw a small, makeshift living space. And there, sitting in a worn-out armchair, was Uncle Teddy, alive but looking frail and haunted.

“Teddy!” I gasped. “What happened?”

Uncle Teddy looked up, his eyes filled with sorrow. “I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said, his voice weak. “Loraine’s drinking, her anger... I needed to escape. Jim helped me. We faked my disappearance so I could live in peace.”

Uncle Jim nodded, tears streaming down his face. “We thought it was the only way. But it’s been eating me alive.”

The revelation hit me like a ton of bricks. Uncle Teddy had been hiding in plain sight, right under our noses. The family’s wild theories, the endless arguments—it had all been for nothing. The truth was stranger than any fiction we could have imagined.

As we helped Uncle Teddy up the ladder, I couldn’t help but think about the lengths people go to for a semblance of peace. The family would have to come to terms with this shocking twist, but for now, Uncle Teddy was finally free from his self-imposed exile.","<brainstorm>
1. Uncle Teddy faked his own disappearance to escape Aunt Loraine's overbearing personality and start a new life.
2. Uncle Jim helped Uncle Teddy disappear because he knew about Teddy's unhappiness and wanted to help him.
3. Aunt Loraine was in on the plan and pretended to believe in the rapture story to cover for Teddy.
4. Uncle Teddy was hiding in plain sight, living in a secret room in Uncle Jim and Aunt Aurelia's house.
5. Uncle Teddy had a terminal illness and wanted to spare the family the pain of watching him deteriorate.
6. Uncle Teddy was part of a witness protection program and had to leave suddenly.
7. Aunt Loraine accidentally killed Uncle Teddy in a drunken rage, and Uncle Jim helped cover it up.
8. Uncle Teddy was actually a spy and had to disappear for a mission.

Combining elements from ideas 1, 2, and 4 could create a compelling twist. Uncle Teddy faked his disappearance with Uncle Jim's help and has been hiding in a secret room in Jim and Aurelia's house. Aunt Loraine was unaware of the plan, genuinely believing in the rapture story.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
As the memorial service began, the family gathered in the church, exchanging hushed whispers and somber glances. Aunt Aurelia sat in the front row, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, while Uncle Jim was conspicuously absent. Just as the service was about to start, the doors at the back of the church creaked open, and in walked Uncle Jim, looking more disheveled than usual.

He made his way to the front, and without preamble, he addressed the congregation. ""I have something to confess,"" he said, his voice trembling. ""It's about Teddy.""

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Uncle Jim took a deep breath and continued, ""Teddy didn't rapture. He didn't disappear because of some divine intervention. He left because he couldn't take it anymore. He needed to escape.""

The room fell silent, everyone hanging on his every word. ""Teddy and I planned his disappearance together. He was unhappy, and he wanted a way out. So, we created the rapture story to give him a clean break. He's been living in a secret room in my house ever since.""

Gasps of shock and disbelief filled the air. Aunt Aurelia looked as stunned as everyone else. ""Jim, what are you saying?"" she whispered.

Uncle Jim turned to her, his eyes filled with regret. ""I'm sorry, Aurelia. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell anyone. Teddy needed to disappear, and I was the only one who could help him.""

At that moment, the doors at the side of the church opened, and in walked Uncle Teddy, looking healthier and more at peace than anyone had ever seen him. The room erupted in chaos, with family members rushing to him, bombarding him with questions.

Teddy raised his hands to quiet them. ""I know this is a shock, but I needed to find myself again. I couldn't do it under the weight of everything. Jim helped me, and for that, I'm grateful. I'm sorry for the pain I've caused, but I hope you can understand.""

The family stood in stunned silence, processing the revelation. Slowly, the shock gave way to relief and understanding. They had their answers, and while the truth was unexpected, it brought a sense of closure.

As the service continued, the family began to heal, united by the surprising twist that had recontextualized everything they thought they knew. Uncle Teddy was back, and while the journey had been tumultuous, they were ready to move forward together.

As the memorial service began, the family gathered in the church, exchanging hushed whispers and somber glances. Aunt Aurelia sat in the front row, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, while Uncle Jim was conspicuously absent. Just as the service was about to start, the doors at the back of the church creaked open, and in walked Uncle Jim, looking more disheveled than usual.

As the service continued, the family began to heal, united by the surprising twist that had recontextualized everything they thought they knew. Uncle Teddy was back, and while the journey had been tumultuous, they were ready to move forward together.
","As the service began, we all took our seats, the air thick with the scent of lilies and the low hum of whispered condolences. The pastor started with a prayer, and then opened the floor for anyone who wanted to share memories of Aunt Loraine. One by one, family members and friends stood up, recounting tales of her vivacious spirit, her infamous cocktails, and her infectious laughter. Despite the somber occasion, there were moments of genuine laughter as we remembered the good times.

Then, just as the pastor was about to conclude, the church doors creaked open. Heads turned, and a collective gasp filled the room. There, standing in the doorway, was Uncle Teddy. He looked exactly the same as the last time we had seen him, down to the brown orthopedic shoes and the old-fashioned white cotton shirt.

Aunt Aurelia fainted, and Hank barely managed to catch her. The rest of us were frozen in shock. Uncle Teddy walked down the aisle, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on the casket. He approached it slowly, almost reverently, and placed a single white rose on top.

""Uncle Teddy?"" I finally managed to croak out, breaking the stunned silence.

He turned to face us, a serene smile on his face. ""Hello, everyone. I see I missed quite a bit.""

The room erupted into chaos. Questions flew at him from all directions: Where had he been? What had happened? How was he here now?

Uncle Teddy raised his hands to quiet us. ""I know you all have questions, and I promise to answer them. But first, let me explain.""

He took a deep breath and began. ""The night I disappeared, I did leave, but not in the way Loraine told you. I had been planning to leave for a long time. I needed to escape, to find myself again. I knew Loraine would never let me go, so I staged my own disappearance. I left my clothes on the balcony to make it look like I had raptured, knowing she would believe it.""

""But why?"" Uncle Jim asked, his voice trembling with emotion.

Uncle Teddy sighed. ""Loraine was a wonderful woman, but she was also controlling and manipulative. I felt suffocated. I needed to breathe, to live my own life. So, I left. I traveled, I found peace, and I found myself. I never intended to come back, but when I heard about Loraine's passing, I knew I had to.""

The room was silent, absorbing his words. Finally, Uncle Jim spoke again. ""Why didn't you tell us? Why let us think you were dead?""

Uncle Teddy looked down, his eyes filled with regret. ""I thought it would be easier for everyone. I didn't want to cause more pain. But I see now that I was wrong. I'm sorry.""

The tension in the room began to dissipate, replaced by a mix of relief and confusion. We had our answers, but they came with a heavy price. Uncle Teddy had returned, but the family would never be the same.

As the service concluded, we gathered around Uncle Teddy, each of us seeking our own closure. The mystery of his disappearance had been solved, but the wounds it left behind would take time to heal. And as we left the church, the sun setting on a day filled with revelations, we knew that our family would move forward, forever changed by the unexpected return of the man who had once disappeared without a trace."," As months passed, Uncle Teddy's presence breathed new life into family gatherings. His return had sparked introspection among relatives who began to question their own lifestyles and choices in light of his confession. Conversations took on a deeper tone; discussions about faith, purpose, and personal growth became as commonplace as talk of the weather or local sports teams.

Aurelia's basement was no longer Teddy’s secret refuge but transformed into a shared space for family therapy sessions with Uncle Jim leading them—a surprising turn considering his previous silence on the matter. The change in Uncle Teddy inspired Jason and me to take our own stand against alcohol, rippling outward through our generation like a stone cast upon calm waters.

The once predictable cycle of intoxication was replaced with moments that celebrated sobriety—a testament to Teddy' vice-like grip on the party spirit. He became an unexpectedly cherished figure, his stories of rapture and redemption serving as catalysts for change within our clan.

Teddy’s decision didn't just alter his life; it shifted a family dynamic that had been stagnant under years of alcohol-fueled monotony. As we raised glasses to Aunt Loraine, they were now filled with laughter and earnest dialogues rather than the bitter taste of liquor. The rapture may have only been for Teddy's peace, but it had awakened a collective longing in all of us—a hunger for something beyond just getting away from our troubles.

In the end, Uncle Teddy’s return became more than just his own salvation; it was as if he had raptured not only himself but also elevated an entire generation to seek their own form of enlightenment.","z f p h"

	Ladies and gentlemen, my weary disposition welcomes you to the main event of this dreary morning commute to the city titled, The Waterloo Station Java Sweepstakes!

As we approach our final destination, everyone is up on their feet, crowding the train’s sliding doors in anticipation of a packed surge of bodies eagerly jockeying for position before collectively spilling out onto Platform Nine.

And… We’re off! The train doors have made way for the jumpers, leapers, and pushers descending onto the concrete walkway, keen to gain an advantage over their morning travelling opponents. Faltering at the step-off, I hurriedly pick up my pace to gain some ground during our platform dash to the exit. Being moderately fit helps, because already there are huffers, puffers, and buffers slowing the race down with their nicotine-starved wheezing. Their progress-delaying freeze-frame positioning acts as random obstacles in the congested break for freedom, creating a type of pinball reaction in those directly behind them. Bodies bounce off the static dilly-dalliers, like jolted energy particles of antimatter reacting in a controlled laboratory experiment. For the stationary wheezers, their morning race is done, because they’ll be heading straight for the outdoors to light up and fill their lungs with slow carcinogenic death.

I remember the days when smoking carriages on trains still existed. The problem was that they outnumbered their counterparts, and if you were late to catch your train, you undoubtedly would end up either standing at the end of the carriage by the malodourous public toilets or inhaling second-hand smoke from the heavy blowfishes in the tobacco friendly carriages. If ever there was a league table of oxymoron descriptions, “tobacco friendly” would be a contender for the title.

The most unpleasant part of getting stuck in any smoking section is the resulting stink accompanying you for hours. Infiltrating clothes and hair, the disgusting smell of burnt baccy breath, can linger for so long that fellow non-smokers would demonstratively sniff in your company, thinking you were a ten-a-day cancer stick consumer.

No amount of cologne could mask that stench. Even lunchtime walks in the local park still left stale remnants of repellent odours lingering like fag-ash pub carpet smells back in the days before common sense saved the lives of second-hand inhalers.

However, all complaining memories aside, this stage of the race is more than survival of the fittest or the capacity of lungs to breathe deeply without coughing up nicotine-infused phlegm. It is a cerebral competition of pacesetters racing to work with a pit stop for a quick caffeine fix. In their minds, first to refuel will be first back on the trekking track, and ahead of the crowd.

The first provider of morning alertness is spotted by the early pace setters, who - with one eye on the prize - hesitatingly file past the ticket inspectors seriously scrutinising the jaded and sullen faces, in search of the few lawbreakers surreptitiously seeking out a free morning commute to work. It appears that the electronic gates have malfunctioned, causing the reserve human alternative to appear in droves.

To the left of the leading group, a random fare dodger has been singled out, causing a bottleneck of impatient competitors squashing into the backs of those before them. Like the wind being shoved out of a silent accordion, a combined exhalation of frustrated breath fills the airwaves. This hasn’t gone down well with those almost through the only open gate, but a helping surge of bodies from the rear, breaks the frontrunners free of the asinine human restraint, causing station staff to quickly surrender their expected morning lassoing of ticketless minions.

This morning, we have one of the frontrunners for the Ticketmaster-of-the-year painstakingly checking receipts and rail passes. Seeing the growing frustration, he quietly smiles, points a finger to one of his gatekeepers, who immediately opens the remaining locked wrought-iron gates - thus preventing the impending stampede of irritated Nine-To-Fivers.

Commuter safety is always foremost in the practice of the public facing responsibilities of the British Transport Services. Any form of societal backlash can be costly. But not always in terms of safety. Many a station staff member has collected their fair share of complaints against them. However, unknown to the people they service, an in-house competition has been running for years, consisting of gatekeepers who can collect the least number of customer complaints against them in a single calendar year. This has led to an improvement in customer relations and inadvertently developed a sense of pride in matters public. The resulting year-end totals are then tallied for the awards section of the staff Christmas party. The winner receiving a bottle of champagne and a small plaque to mount on the staffroom wall. In a world of competitiveness, even the smallest of trophies allows one the opportunity of bragging rights amongst one’s peers.

But avoiding complaints and catching fare avoiders streaming from my train, is not the only pursuit of the day. So, although the opening of the gates is fuelled by safety concerns, station staff are assuredly filled with confidence that they will eventually achieve their daily targets, possibly surpassing the record for the number of on-the-spot-fines to free-grazing riders in a single shift. You see, besides the lowest complaints contest, a parallel revenue-generating game also comes with a prize. So, staff on this chilly morning have a reinforced visible presence at all of Waterloo Stations’ twenty-four platforms.

Relieved and unshackled from the restraints of the previous closed gates, a melee of grunting, swearing, complaining mouths – some with one foot blatantly still in Sleepland - once more surge forward in the naïve hope for a short day in a stuffy office, a quick drink in the pub to avoid the evening rush home, and a bit more sleep than the previous night. This is the big city, and it is easy to forget that only the strongest, the most alert, the shrewdest, will succeed in that fantasy. It is of no wonder then, that Friday becomes the release time of the week’s pent-up emotions and frustrations - where some seek the solace of work friends and alcohol to complain to each other about those not in their little work cliques, while others enjoy the comfort of drowning out the hum of their stressful week by getting all-out, shit-faced drunk.

Saturday will come and go. Then, Sunday will arrive with the expectation of bliss and relaxation, only for that fleeting sentiment to fade in the early evening - replaced with the characteristic dread of the approaching Monday morning. Visions of another weeklong cattle drive to and from work, often make for sleepless Sunday nights.

Snapping back into focus, I visually canvass the available boutique coffee stalls and vans on concourse display, as I zig and I zag, my eyes following several potential small lines of coffee seekers racing to crowd the inundated bleary-eyed baristas trying very hard to put on a brave smile, while listening to collective rude shouts of separate coffee orders. These are not the places I seek, so spotting a smaller van no more than forty meters from my position, I dart quickly on nimble toes, avoiding the criss-crossing of blinkered commuters bumping into each other, while running for the exits – some, late for work, others, rushing for their commuter connections in the underground railway. But, as I approach the vehicle, a separate crowd of arrivals from platform five flood the concourse like a school of sardines emptying from a fishing net. They quickly beat me to my objective, causing a growing queue at the small Tuk-Tuk style coffee van, and a change of tactics for me - although of what they are, I am not yet sure.

Halting, I teeter on the edge of defeat wondering if my race is run for the day, but in the corner of my eye, I spot a wireframed barrow with a sign that displays the name, “The Old Sicilian.” It’s situated in a little nook between one of the stations’ public toilets and an international newsstand – almost lost to the rushing hordes late for work. What is more intriguing and appealing to me, is that no-one is waiting in line to purchase anything. There is still time to beat some of my work colleagues to the office, so I sidestep a few slow movers and walk with a brisk pace toward the charming-looking coffee stand.

Getting to work and settling in before certain people at the office arrive, is another race I play on my daily commute. It has an underlying motive, because these specific individuals are clock watchers, and their own clock is not the only one they take note of. They revel in mentioning to everyone – should you leave early from work – your obvious absence from your desk. It brings unwanted attention to those that just need to get away from biased scrutiny. So, creating the appearance of being in the office for quite some time before they get there, allows one to free oneself early from the “Jobsworth” attendance monitors. It also puts those lucky escapees – namely, yours truly - in pole position for an early race home.

My thoughts wander as I peruse the coffee menu on the small stand; however, my attention is quickly captured by the quaint Roman design of the beverage menu attached to the face of the cart. Every item seems out of the ordinary from the general servings that other java merchants provide. There are varieties like Roman Road – with a drawing of a full mug labelled, The Appian Way along with a description of the drink resembling a marshmallow coffee served by many of the surrounding rivals for your morning money. There is also a Roman Spring – similar to a cross between a cappuccino and a latte. A Saturnalia – where the coffee is on top, resembling a reversed Affogate that uses a scoop of ice cream in the mug, but placed at the bottom of it.

The one that catches my attention is something called a Mount Etna Java Flow. Querying the beverage, the aging barista explains to me that it is a drink like a double espresso but thick in texture. He goes on to describe it as liquid magma spurting from the rim of a mug. “If you-ah still sleepy,” he jokes in a thick Italian accent. “This will-ah spring your eyelids to attention.”

I nod my approval and select the lava-filled mug, then patiently wait for its dispensing - turning to watch the melee of bodies rushing past this secretive hole-in-the-wall coffee stand.

I don’t have long to wait before the wise-looking Italian gentleman offers me an exquisite and aromatic tall ceramic shot mug of Roman design on a matching saucer. Before I can gently protest that I need the drink to take away, he pre-empts my reluctance by saying five stern words to me, as he comfortingly smiles.

“We don’t-ah do plastic ‘ere.”

My raised eyebrows prompt him to elucidate. He reciprocates by explaining,

“It’s-ah like-ah dis,” he begins. “We throw away so many-ah things in life. Old-ah furniture, old-ah clothes, renewable materials like-ah da plastic cups, for instance. And-ah relationships that make us more lonelier than-ah ever. Butta the most importanteh thing we cannot-ah hold on to, is time – the most-ah precious commodity. Butta instead, we rush through-ah life trying to get-ah here and get-ah there, never stopping to smella da life passing by at a much faster rate than we can keep-ah upper with. We always inna hurry to get-ah somewhere. We treat-ah life like a never-ending race. But whatta good issa racing to a finish line that-ah no-one canna see until-ah the priest, he blesses your coffin?”

He demonstrates the Catholic benediction toward me, while I stand mesmerised at the old man’s blunt but insightful words. So intensely is my stare, he snaps me out of it by ordering me to drink.

“Don’t-ah let the lava get-ah cold. Coz-ah you will need a shovel to-ah dig it out.”

He smiles at his little joke - while encouraging me to consume the entire vessel’s contents. Obligingly, I down the drink in a style resembling the Friday night shots of Jägermeister that me and my own clique of workmates throw down our gullets at the Bierkeller in Covent Garden. However, this was no smooth alcoholic liquorice and aniseed cordial derivative. It was thick, syrupy delight that trickled slowly down my throat toward my awaiting stomach, filling me with merry coffee-berry-resplendent-pleasure.

After licking the rim of the Roman chalice, I hand it and the saucer back to the “Vecchio uomo,” curiously wondering why I’m describing an Italian old man in his native tongue.

“Grazie,” I say – going with the flow like Mount Etna’s magma was oozing from my mouth.

“Prego, signore,” he replies. “I wanna show you-ah something.”

Before I can object, the old man guides me to stand on one of his tables dotted around the cart. Directing my gaze to the mad morning dash of commuters passing by, he sweeps his arms in a vista pattern, prompting me to take in the scene.

“Now-ah, look outta there and tell me whatta you see. Issa alright. I hold onto the table so you don’t-ah fall.”

I play along and for several moments study the crowds making straight lines toward unseen destinations. An instant surge of adrenalin begins to place me in a very alert state of mind. The old man senses this in the small jerk of my table stance.

“You awake-ah now, Sì? Mag-ah-ma becomes-ah lava. Lava becomes-ah free from itssa restraints,” he instructively explains.

He is right. Clarity courses through my awakening mind like dawn had just risen from a very long, dark night.

“Tell-ah me whatta you see, signore,” he asks in a more demanding tone of voice.

“I see… ants!” I blurt out in cognisant tone.

“Sì,” he responds. “But-ah without-ah organisation, without communicating to-ah each other assa to where they need to go. Greedy, unsharing, and-ah without insight, they frantically passah me by every day like-ah time for them issa just a race to beat-ah da clock.”

In one long breath, he imparts his observations like a documentarian broadcasting to a large television audience.

“We have-ah a saying in-ah Sicily that goes,

Supra lu majuri si ‘nsigna lu minuri.

We learn by-ah standing onna the shoulders of the wise.”

Before I can commend him on his forthright imparting of a sensible Sicilian proverb, he continues.

“Itta means to listen to those gone before you and-ah to always gain a higher perspective of-ah the playing field. Too many seekka out the easiest path, or the most-ah convenient, so they do not see the other options calmly awaiting their arrival in the quiet-ah corners of life. But, you-ah certainly did, Giovane uomo.”

“Giovane,” I repeat. “That means, young, doesn’t it?” My understanding of Italian improving with every jolt of Mount Etna’s caffeine hitting me.

“Sì,” he smiles in the satisfaction that there is at least one person he has truly communicated with on this grey morning. “You get-ah down, now,” he instructs. “More-ah customers await.”

Rather than jumping down and risking potential injury to my ankles, I drop to my knees and backward-crawl my way off the table.

","

“I’d better be off, then,” I bid an explanatory farewell, before turning to wave at him. But both to my surprise and disconcertment, all that greets me is an empty nook where the coffee stand had stood just moments ago, and on the nook’s indented wall, is a dated travel poster depicting an old man welcoming the reader to Sicily with the Italian words, Cu Nesci arrinesci above the English translation that reads, Those who leave their own comfort zone succeed.

My eyes move further down the poster to the tagline that is both poignant and soberly awakening. It reads, Get away from the rat race. Sicily awaits your arrival!

Was I in some form of daydream in my slumbering disorder of morning tiredness? Or did I just enter a magical corner of Waterloo Station, where clarity freely offers its guidance without seeking compensation? I mean, if walls could talk, these are very old walls indeed, with much wisdom to offer those that stop and listen.

Most certainly, a refreshed lucid mind possesses me like the description on the poster. The previous few moments of my confused state of mind matter not because I have suddenly awoken to the sound of a new race. The race to my wellbeing, where time slows to my pace. Where I will not be coerced, manipulated, or intimidated into becoming a slave to the system. What I mean to say is that I will no longer watch time pass before me. I will lasso it like the ticket collector on platform nine wrangles those that skirt the fare paying law. I will be a master of my own destiny. An enthusiastic participant of life and not a spectator waiting until it’s too late to act – where I like others before me, helplessly look up at the priest blessing my casket.

As I slowly saunter back into the onrush of proverbial headless chickens slurping scalding coffee from plastic cups, wolfing down sugary donuts as they trot along, and spilling crumbling baked muffins onto the ground; the world moves around me at such a fast pace, that I find myself becoming a slow-moving buffer amongst the pinball herd of ticking-time livestock. My newly discovered awareness, pledges to concentrate on what is most important to me - the control of my own life, its passage through time, and the air that I breathe. I promise to continue to gain a clearer perspective on life; and whenever possible, to stand on the shoulders of the wise.

My race has come to an end, but not in the sense of terminal or of downfall. More so, in the belief that there is more to life than what is dictated to us by the norm…","As I step off the table, I feel a strange sense of clarity and purpose. The old man’s words resonate deeply within me, and I realize that I’ve been living my life in a constant rush, never stopping to appreciate the moments that truly matter. I thank him once more and turn to leave, but he stops me with a gentle hand on my shoulder.

“Wait-ah, signore,” he says, his eyes twinkling with a mysterious light. “I have-ah something for you.”

He reaches under the counter and pulls out a small, intricately carved wooden box. He hands it to me with a knowing smile.

“Open it when-ah you get to work,” he instructs. “It will-ah help you see things more-ah clearly.”

I nod, intrigued, and slip the box into my bag. As I make my way through the bustling station, I feel a newfound sense of calm. The frantic energy of the commuters no longer affects me; instead, I move with purpose, like a leaf carried by a gentle stream.

When I finally arrive at the office, I settle into my desk and pull out the wooden box. My heart races with anticipation as I carefully lift the lid. Inside, I find a small, ornate mirror and a folded piece of parchment. I unfold the parchment and read the elegant script:

“Look into the mirror and see the truth that lies within.”

I hold the mirror up to my face, expecting to see my own reflection. But instead, the surface shimmers and shifts, revealing a scene that takes my breath away. It’s a vision of my life, but not as it is now. It’s a life filled with joy, love, and fulfillment. I see myself surrounded by friends and family, pursuing my passions, and living each moment to the fullest.

Tears well up in my eyes as I realize what the old man was trying to show me. I’ve been so focused on the race, on the destination, that I’ve forgotten to enjoy the journey. I’ve been living a life dictated by the clock, but now I see that true happiness comes from within, from appreciating the moments that make life worth living.

As I lower the mirror, I feel a profound sense of peace. I know that my life will never be the same. The old man’s wisdom has given me a gift far greater than any cup of coffee. It has given me the clarity to see what truly matters and the courage to live my life with purpose and intention.

From that day forward, I approach each morning with a sense of gratitude and wonder. I no longer rush through life, but instead, I savor each moment, knowing that the true prize is not at the end of the race, but in the journey itself. And every now and then, I visit “The Old Sicilian” to thank the wise barista who changed my life forever.","<brainstorm>
1. The old man is not just a barista but a retired detective who uses his coffee stand to observe and catch criminals in the crowd.
2. The protagonist realizes that the old man’s coffee has a special ingredient that enhances perception and awareness, making him see things he normally wouldn’t.
3. The protagonist discovers that the old man is actually a ghost, and the coffee stand is a portal to another dimension.
4. The protagonist finds out that the old man is part of a secret society that helps people break free from the monotony of their daily lives.
5. The protagonist learns that the old man’s coffee stand is a front for a hidden treasure hunt, and the coffee he drank contains a clue.

I like the idea of the old man being a retired detective who uses his coffee stand to observe and catch criminals. This twist can recontextualize the protagonist’s experience and provide a satisfying resolution to the story.

<ending>
As I step down from the table, the old man’s words echo in my mind. I feel a newfound clarity and awareness, as if the Mount Etna Java Flow has unlocked a hidden potential within me. I thank the old man and start to walk away, but something compels me to turn back.

“Excuse me, sir,” I say, “but I have to ask. Why did you choose to set up your coffee stand here, in this hidden corner of the station?”

The old man’s eyes twinkle with a knowing smile. “Ah, Giovane uomo, you are more perceptive than most. Letta me show you something.”

He reaches under the counter and pulls out a worn leather notebook. Flipping it open, he reveals pages filled with sketches, notes, and photographs of various people. I recognize some of the faces from the morning commute.

“I used to be a detective,” he explains. “When I retired, I couldn’t just sit idly by. So, I set up this coffee stand to observe the crowds. You’d be surprised what you can learn from watching people in their daily routines.”

I glance at the notebook and notice a familiar face. It’s the Ticketmaster-of-the-year, the one who was painstakingly checking receipts and rail passes earlier. Next to his photo, there are notes about suspicious activities and connections to a larger criminal network.

“You see,” the old man continues, “I’ve been tracking a group of fare dodgers who are part of a bigger scheme. They use the morning rush to blend in and avoid detection. But with my coffee stand, I can observe them without drawing attention.”

I’m stunned. The old man’s coffee stand is not just a quaint little nook; it’s a covert operation to catch criminals. The Mount Etna Java Flow wasn’t just a delicious drink; it was a tool to sharpen my senses and make me more aware of my surroundings.

“Thank you,” I say, genuinely grateful. “I’ll keep my eyes open from now on.”

The old man nods, his smile widening. “Remember, Giovane uomo, life is not just a race. It’s about seeing the bigger picture and making a difference.”

As I walk away, I feel a sense of purpose and excitement. The daily commute will never be the same again. I’ve been given a new perspective, and I’m ready to see the world with fresh eyes.

And who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll join the old man in his quiet corner, helping to make the world a little bit better, one cup of coffee at a time.

I glance at the notebook and notice a familiar face. It’s the Ticketmaster-of-the-year, the one who was painstakingly checking receipts and rail passes earlier. Next to his photo, there are notes about suspicious activities and connections to a larger criminal network.

“You see,” the old man continues, “I’ve been tracking a group of fare dodgers who are part of a bigger scheme. They use the morning rush to blend in and avoid detection. But with my coffee stand, I can observe them without drawing attention.”

I’m stunned. The old man’s coffee stand is not just a quaint little nook; it’s a covert operation to catch criminals. The Mount Etna Java Flow wasn’t just a delicious drink; it was a tool to sharpen my senses and make me more aware of my surroundings.

“Thank you,” I say, genuinely grateful. “I’ll keep my eyes open from now on.”

The old man nods, his smile widening. “Remember, Giovane uomo, life is not just a race. It’s about seeing the bigger picture and making a difference.”

As I walk away, I feel a sense of purpose and excitement. The daily commute will never be the same again. I’ve been given a new perspective, and I’m ready to see the world with fresh eyes.

And who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll join the old man in his quiet corner, helping to make the world a little bit better, one cup of coffee at a time.
","As I step off the table, I feel a strange sense of enlightenment, as if the old man’s words have unlocked a hidden door in my mind. I thank him profusely, feeling a newfound respect for the wisdom he has shared. He nods, his eyes twinkling with a knowing look, and returns to his cart to serve the next customer.

I glance at my watch and realize that, despite the detour, I still have time to make it to the office before the clock-watchers arrive. With a spring in my step, I navigate through the bustling crowd, but this time, I’m not just another ant in the colony. I’m aware, observant, and oddly at peace.

As I approach the office building, I notice something peculiar. The usual crowd of commuters is gathered around the entrance, but they’re not moving. They’re staring at something, their faces a mix of confusion and curiosity. I push my way through the throng to see what’s causing the commotion.

There, in the middle of the lobby, is a large, ornate mirror that wasn’t there before. It’s framed in gold, with intricate designs that seem almost ancient. The mirror reflects the bustling scene around it, but there’s something off. The reflections are not quite right. People are moving in the mirror, but they’re not matching the movements of those in the lobby. It’s as if the mirror is showing a different reality.

I step closer, my curiosity piqued. As I peer into the mirror, I see myself, but not as I am now. The reflection shows me in a different life, a different path. I’m not rushing to work; I’m sitting at a café, leisurely sipping coffee, a book in hand. I look content, at peace, and most importantly, happy.

A chill runs down my spine as I realize the significance of what I’m seeing. The old man’s words echo in my mind: “Too many seekka out the easiest path, or the most-ah convenient, so they do not see the other options calmly awaiting their arrival in the quiet-ah corners of life.”

I step back, my heart pounding. The mirror is showing me what could be, what my life might look like if I stopped racing against the clock and started living with intention. The realization is both terrifying and exhilarating.

I turn away from the mirror, the crowd still buzzing with confusion. I know what I have to do. I walk out of the office building, my mind made up. Today, I won’t be just another commuter. Today, I’ll start living my life with purpose, seeking out those quiet corners and hidden opportunities.

As I make my way back to the train station, I feel a sense of liberation. The old man’s words have given me a new perspective, and I’m ready to embrace it. I glance back at the office one last time, a smile playing on my lips. The race is over, and I’ve already won."," As I reflect on my unexpected encounter with the wise ""Vecchio uomo"" at Covent Garden's Bierkeller, a profound sense of gratitude fills me. His words echoed through my thoughts long after our brief interaction, illuminating a path that deviated from the hustle and bustle of daily routine towards introspection and personal growth.

It was as if he had handed me the keys to an ancient library filled with wisdom, challenging me to choose which tomes would enrich my soul. With each step away from that impromptu coffee table in the midst of urban chaos, I felt a burgeoning responsibility toward self-mastery and authentic living. The metap

The ""Vecchio uomo"" had not only imparted Sicilian wisdom but also demonstrated how life's subtleties can be as enriching as its loudest moments. His coffee stand vanished, leaving behind a poster that served both as a reminder of our encounter and a symbolic guidepost for my journey ahead.

The clarity I gained from the old man was not just about seeing the world differently; it was a catalyst for transformation. It became clear to me then, amidst the clattering trains and frenzied commuters, that life's tempo need not dictate our rhythms if we dare to compose our own melodies.

I walked away with more than just caffeine in my system; I carried a newfound resolve to navigate the intricacies of existence by embracing wisdom and eschewing conformity. The lesson was not lost on me: time may be finite, but our capacity for growth is boundless—if we only dare to climb higher upon the shoulders of those who came before us.

My journey does not end here; it merely transforms into a path paved with conscious choices and deliberate actions. In the grand scheme of things, I am no longer just another face in the crowd but an active participant shaping my destiny, one sip at a time.","p h f z"
"18",18," Morning Run ",18,528,"2/2/2024","Statement to Park Police, 9:17 AM, September 18

Sure.

This morning started like any other. Began my run at 6:30 as usual, took the same route.

Well. I mean, except…

Except I’m halfway to the lake on the parkway when I decide to deviate from the paved path to run along the unpaved trail next to the creek. I don’t know why. Maybe because snow’s going to fly soon, and I’m already nostalgic for summer even if the heat was brutal this year. Maybe I want to see the changing leaves. Maybe I’m simply sick of the same route. Is this really important?

Okay. Here, just after this little low-hanging bridge with lots of sharp metal jutting from its side, I notice something in the creek, looks like a large log, floating in the shallow water. Only, when I see the colors are too bright—reds and oranges and blues— I slow my pace and it isn’t till I’m a few feet away that I realize it’s clothing. Then that the clothing has form, arms, legs a torso. But no head. I’m wondering if it’s maybe a dummy or a mannequin. Which would be weird enough.

But.

God, it’s a freaking human body, so I scream like there’s no tomorrow, but there’s no one around to hear me. I mean it’s only just after 6:30, like I said, still pretty dark out. I puke, I mean who wouldn’t, seeing that thing floating there? Soon as I could gather myself, I call you guys.

No, I have no idea who it is. I mean, how would I know. It doesn’ have a face.

Yeah, no, I’m okay. Just shaken up, you know? Thanks for the tissue. 

No, I really don’t have anything else to tell you guys.

The police station? Oh, with the like real police. I guess so. How long? Okay. I’ll have to call work.

~

Interview with Primary Witness to Metropolitan Police, 11:35 AM, September 18

Okay, yeah, I’ll tell you what I told the park police. 

This morning was normal. I decided to deviate a little from my usual route to run alongside the creek instead of on the paved path above it to enjoy the temperate weather and catch the changing leaves before winter.

Halfway to the lake I saw something big floating in the water.  As soon as I realized it was a human body, I called the park police. I gave them my statement and they brought me here. 

That’s it. 

Why do I think I’m here? To tell you what I just told you, I guess.

I guess I couldn’t really see the changing leaves in the dark, you’re right. Just a whim, then, the changed route. 

Oh, was it a few hours after sunrise that I called the police? I must have been in shock, seeing this body and all. Time passed weirdly. 

No, I didn’t know him. It. How would I know since he didn’t have a head?

Oh, my god. How do you know it was him if he didn’t have ID on him? 

Who cares how I knew about no ID!! The Park police must have told me or I guessed or something! That was the man I loved! I’m in total shock. It’s really him? I can’t. I can’t believe this.

Could I have a second or two to take this all in?! 

Yes, water, please. 

A little better, thanks. 

So how did you identify him?

Ah. No, I had no idea he was in the system nor that he had a youthful arrest. Assault and battery doesn’t really surprise me, I guess. 

Blood on my legs and shoes? I guess I didn’t notice. That’s so gross. Maybe there was blood in the grass on the shoreline, I don’t know. So gross, god. I feel sick.

My fingernails? You want to take samples from under my nails? Why? My hands are clean, like really clean, but sure. And you want a urine test? I’m an avid runner, guys, I’ve never touched a drug in my life. But I want to cooperate.

Only, I’d like to call a lawyer first.

Interview Continues Post Lab Results, 1:45 PM, September 18

Yes, I moved out three weeks ago, for a little break. We were having a few…problems.

Why does that matter?

Oh, god…I’m pregnant?! I had no idea.

Arrest me? For murder?! How would I have done this? Decapitated him and dumped his body in the creek? He was a very big man. Besides, why would I? I loved him. I’m having his baby, for chrissakes!

Traces of dirt and his blood under my nails? That makes no sense! My hands are so clean.

I think…I’m done talking till my lawyer gets here.

Statement of Murder Suspect to Metropolitan Police, Defendant’s Attorney Present, 3:50 PM September 18

My lawyer has advised me to tell you the truth. So here it is. It’s ugly, but I didn’t kill anyone.

I did go for a run this morning, like I said. 

When I got home, he was there, waiting for me at the kitchen table. 

When were you going to tell me you were pregnant? He asked me so low I knew I was in trouble.

 I didn’t think I owed you the courtesy, I said, like a total idiot. We broke up, and it’s my body.

Your body is carrying my child, and I learn about it from one of your stupid friends? he said. I can still feel his spit in my face.

He was in that kind of white-hot rage that had nowhere to go but through me. That doesn’t happen often, but it happens. And when it does, I always end up at the clinic with a little “running” injury.  

I hadn’t taken off my shoes yet, so I ran back out the door and onto the parkway. I don’t have any idea why I went that way, stupid force of habit, my rabbit brain taking over, maybe. I mean, why didn’t I just pound on a neighbor’s door?

All I knew, all I felt, though, was run.

I could hear him huffing loudly behind, commanding me to stop, but I would never stop, not with the safety of my little one at risk. It was still dark out, but I know that route like the back of my hand. He’s not into exercise or the outdoors, so I can count on one hand the number of times he’s been on the parkway. And unlike a lot of the city, it can get really dark along that stretch. 

He fell behind a little, but he’d never give up, so I kept running. It wasn’t until I neared the lake and the sun was rising that I let up enough to look back. No sign. 

I was pretty sure he didn’t know about the unpaved path below the paved one, so I decided to double back out of sight until I caught sight of him, then try to sneak back to my house. Yeah, I wasn’t thinking too clearly. 

Anyway. I crept back, yard after excruciating yard, but he was nowhere. I began to hope that maybe he had given up, but when I reached the little tunnel under that bridge, I saw something at the mouth on the other side. 

I approached cautiously. It looked like a soccer ball or something, but it hadn’t been there before. Yes, you guessed it, it was his head. 

I screamed my bloody head off, but no one was around. Then I noticed his body in the creek.

I panicked, completely freaked out, sure everyone would think I had done this. I should have just gone home, showered, and let someone else find him, but something in me was compelled to see this through, to make sure no one could connect the body to me. Thinking that he couldn’t be identified without his head or ID, I buried both, then called you. Again, not thinking clearly. 

The self-decapitation? I’m pretty sure he didn’t duck going under the bridge and the razor sharp metal sticking out, sliced clean through his neck. Check the metal. It was dripping blood. That part is up to you to figure out though, right?

Yes, I’ll show you where I buried them. 

Anyway, I didn’t kill him, 

He accidentally killed himself.

Suspect’s Journal Entry Found in Home Search

Sept. 17

Dear Diary,

I’ve come up with way to end it. It’s risky, but then everything having to do with him is risky. Probably why I was attracted to him in the first place, I guess, that flirting with dangerous men gene I get from my mom. I know she’d agree that I have no other option. If she were still alive.

It has to happen tomorrow morning. Baby will grow to the point where she slows me down soon, and this plan relies on my comparative speed. I’ve called the city like 30 times about that bridge, to no avail.

So.

I’ll call tonight and say I need to see him early, right after my run, to tell him something important. He’s always grumpier in the early morning, and as he always says, I know how to rile him up better than anyone.  

The rest should take care of itself.

Defense Attorney’s Closing Argument to Grand Jury, 1:11 PM, April 29

The prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, has not provided proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that my client was in any way responsible for the accidental death of this man. They have not produced any physical evidence suggesting my client, a woman who weighs 100 pounds less than the deceased, could have cut off his head and thrown him into the creek.

Her initial statements to police paint the picture of a woman traumatized. A woman who, as the expert psychologists called to witness pointed out, spoke erroneously due to post-traumatic stress syndrome, and a desire to do only one thing—protect her child. Her diary entry proves nothing at all except more of the same—trauma and fear.

As for the victim’s death, all the evidence points only to one fact: that a bridge, maintained poorly by the city, is to blame for his admittedly grisly death. If anything, blame the city.

Meanwhile, all we’ve seen is that my client, traumatized and abused by her former partner for years, acted of self-defense to save herself and her unborn child with the only weapons she had—her running shoes. 

And so she ran, folks, on a dark path she knew like the back of her hand, away from this man, a violent and abusive man, who followed her, likely with intent to harm her. He did not know this path, and he paid for it. 

And that is the whole story.

On rare occasion, the universe doles out natural justice, where the good persevere and the bad are punished. This, folks, is one of those times. Don’t undo this moment of universal balance by making the wrong decision. Don’t punish the victims, mother and child, of an atrocious man who ultimately deserved what he got.

Do the right thing. Find my client not guilty on all counts.

~

Jury’s Decision. Deliberation Time, 23 minutes

We the jury, find the defendant Not Guilty on the count of obstruction of justice with vote of 12 to zero. 

On the count of manslaughter with intent to harm, we also find the defendant Not Guilty with a vote of 12 to zero.","The detective leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing as he studied her. ""You expect us to believe that he decapitated himself by accident?""

She nodded, her face a mask of sincerity. ""Yes, that's exactly what happened. I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's the truth.""

The detective sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Alright, let's say for a moment we believe your story. Why didn't you just call us immediately? Why go through the trouble of burying the head and the ID?""

She hesitated, her eyes darting to her lawyer, who gave a slight nod. ""I panicked. I was scared. I didn't want anyone to think I had anything to do with it.""

The detective leaned forward, his eyes piercing into hers. ""You know, we did check the metal under that bridge. There was blood, just like you said. But there was something else too.""

Her eyes widened slightly, but she remained silent.

""We found traces of a substance on the metal. A lubricant, to be precise. The kind used to make a blade cut more smoothly.""

Her lawyer stiffened, but she remained calm. ""I don't know anything about that.""

The detective smirked. ""You see, we also found a can of that same lubricant in your garage. And your fingerprints were all over it.""

Her face paled, but she quickly regained her composure. ""That doesn't prove anything. It could have been there for any reason.""

The detective stood up, walking around the table to stand behind her. ""You know, it's funny. We also found a receipt for a hacksaw in your trash. Bought just a few days ago.""

Her lawyer interjected, ""This is all circumstantial. You have no concrete evidence linking my client to the murder.""

The detective leaned down, whispering in her ear. ""We also found a witness. A jogger who saw you arguing with him that morning. Saw you push him towards the bridge.""

Her eyes widened in shock, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out.

The detective straightened up, walking back to his seat. ""You see, we have more than enough to charge you with murder. And the jury will believe it. Because the truth is, you didn't just run that morning. You planned this. You lured him there, knowing he'd chase you. You knew about the sharp metal under the bridge. You made sure it was sharp enough to do the job.""

She slumped in her chair, her facade finally crumbling. ""I didn't mean to kill him. I just wanted to scare him, to make him leave me alone.""

The detective shook his head. ""Well, you did more than scare him. And now, you're going to pay for it.""

As they led her away in handcuffs, she glanced back at the detective, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and defiance. ""You think you've won, but this isn't over.""

The detective watched her go, a grim smile on his face. ""Oh, it's over. For you, it's definitely over.""","<brainstorm>
1. The protagonist's lawyer is actually the one who killed the victim, and the protagonist is being framed.
2. The protagonist has a split personality and doesn't remember committing the murder.
3. The victim was involved in illegal activities, and his associates killed him, making it look like the protagonist did it.
4. The protagonist's ""running injuries"" were actually inflicted by someone else who had a vendetta against the victim.
5. The protagonist's pregnancy is a lie, and she used it as a cover for her actions.
6. The protagonist's friend, who informed the victim about the pregnancy, is the real murderer and had a motive to kill him.
7. The protagonist's story about the bridge and the metal is a fabrication to cover up a premeditated murder.

The best idea seems to be that the protagonist's friend, who informed the victim about the pregnancy, is the real murderer. This twist would recontextualize the protagonist's actions and provide a satisfying resolution to the mystery.
</brainstorm>

The room fell silent as the detective leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing. ""You said one of your friends told him about the pregnancy. Who was it?""

The protagonist hesitated, glancing at her lawyer, who nodded. ""It was Sarah. She’s my best friend. I confided in her about the pregnancy.""

The detective exchanged a look with his partner. ""We need to bring Sarah in for questioning.""

Hours later, Sarah sat in the same chair, her face pale. ""I didn't mean for any of this to happen,"" she stammered. ""I just wanted to scare him, to make him leave her alone.""

The detective leaned forward. ""Tell us everything.""

Sarah took a deep breath. ""I knew he was abusive. When she told me she was pregnant, I was terrified for her and the baby. I thought if he knew, he might back off. But when I told him, he got furious. He said he was going to confront her.""

She paused, tears streaming down her face. ""I followed him that morning. I saw him chasing her, and I panicked. I knew about the sharp metal under the bridge. I thought if I could just scare him, make him stop...""

The detective's eyes widened. ""You knew about the metal?""

Sarah nodded. ""I used to run that path too. I saw him go under the bridge, and I... I pushed him. I didn't mean to kill him, just to stop him. But he didn't duck, and the metal... it was an accident.""

The room was silent as the weight of her confession settled. The detective finally spoke. ""You understand this changes everything. You're under arrest for manslaughter.""

As Sarah was led away, the protagonist sat in stunned silence. Her lawyer placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. ""You're free to go. You're not guilty of his death.""

The protagonist nodded, tears of relief and sorrow mingling. She had lost the man she once loved, but she had also been freed from his shadow. And now, she had a future to think about, for herself and her unborn child.

The detective's voice broke through her thoughts. ""We'll need to take you home, make sure you're safe.""

She nodded, standing on shaky legs. As she left the station, the morning sun cast long shadows, but for the first time in a long while, she felt a glimmer of hope. The nightmare was over, and she was ready to start anew.

Statement of Park Maintenance Worker to Metropolitan Police, 4:30 PM, September 18

I was doing my rounds early this morning, like I always do. I start at 5:00 AM, checking the trails and making sure everything’s in order. I was near the creek when I heard a scream. It was loud, panicked. I ran towards the sound, but by the time I got there, it was quiet again. I didn’t see anyone, so I figured it was just some kids messing around.

But then, I saw her. She was running like the devil was on her heels. I didn’t think much of it at the time. People run in the park all the time, right? But she looked scared. Really scared.

I went back to my rounds, but something didn’t sit right with me. So, I decided to check the area where I heard the scream. That’s when I saw the blood. It was on the metal under the bridge. Fresh, still dripping. I followed the trail and found the head. God, it was gruesome. I’ve seen a lot in my years working here, but nothing like that.

I called it in right away. I didn’t touch anything, just waited for you guys to show up. I didn’t see the body in the creek until later when you all arrived. 

No, I didn’t see anyone else around. Just her, running like her life depended on it.

Statement of Park Police Officer to Metropolitan Police, 5:00 PM, September 18

We received a call from a jogger about a body in the creek. When we arrived, she was visibly shaken, but cooperative. She led us to the site, and we secured the area. The body was headless, floating in the shallow water. It was a gruesome scene.

We took her statement, and she seemed genuinely distressed. She mentioned she had no idea who the victim was, but her story had inconsistencies. The timeline didn’t add up, and her demeanor shifted when we pressed her.

We found blood on her shoes and legs, which she claimed she didn’t notice. That was suspicious. We also found dirt and blood under her fingernails, which she couldn’t explain. 

We brought her in for further questioning, and that’s when things got interesting. She admitted to a confrontation with the victim, who she identified as her ex-partner. She claimed he chased her, and in his rage, he accidentally decapitated himself on the metal under the bridge.

She then admitted to burying the head and his ID to avoid suspicion. She led us to the burial site, and we recovered both.

Final Statement of Murder Suspect to Metropolitan Police, Defendant’s Attorney Present, 6:00 PM, September 18

I’ve told you everything. I didn’t kill him. He was chasing me, and he didn’t see the metal under the bridge. It was an accident. I panicked and buried the head and his ID because I was scared no one would believe me. 

I loved him, despite everything. I’m carrying his child. Why would I kill him?

I know it looks bad, but you have to believe me. It was an accident. 

Please, you have to believe me.

Post-Interview Analysis by Lead Detective, 7:00 PM, September 18

The suspect’s story is bizarre, but the evidence supports her claim. The blood on the metal under the bridge matches the victim’s. The angle and depth of the cut are consistent with a high-speed impact. 

Her panic and subsequent actions, while suspicious, are understandable given the circumstances. 

We’ll need to corroborate her story with further investigation, but at this point, it appears to be a tragic accident rather than a premeditated murder.

Case remains open pending further evidence."," In a solemn yet emotionally charged courtroom, twelve voices rose in unison, echoing the final words that would forever change the course of this trial: ""We the jury, find the defendant Not Guilty on the count of obstruction of justice with vote of 12 to zero. On the count of manslaughter with intent to harm, we also find the defendant Not Guilty with a vote of 12 to zero."" As those words hung in the air, a collective sigh reverberated through the room—a mixture of relief and disbelief for some, vindication for others. The prosecution's case had crumbled under the weight of its own shortcomings; their narrative had been dissected and unraveled by a defense attorney who painted not just an argument, but a picture—a harrowing tale of self-defense in the face of imminent danger. The jury's decision was clear: natural justice prevailed in this rare instance where the good were exonerated and a dark past finally exacted its due upon one who deserved it most.","z h f p"

I used to think that I wasn’t getting enough sleep. I probably don’t, but I manage to get through the ten-hour day, plus an hour commute each way, and do at least an hour workout after dinner, do the dishes, make my lunch, practice a foreign language, and read a book for an hour or two. Roughly translated, I should have seven to eight hours of sleep a night.

I take my coffee to the back deck and enjoy the morning. I read my email, check my social pages, and do some yoga.

My favorite bit is to spend a few minutes standing at the southwest corner of my deck looking out over my neighbor’s backyard, across the valley, and gaze across Port Susan, a part of the branch of the Puget Sound that runs between the City of Stanwood and the east shore of Camano Island.

When my husband and I made an offer on this house, it was pouring down rain and was very dark and dreary. A few months later, on a chilly but clear day in February, while enjoying my coffee on the deck, I made a fantastic discovery. There was a view that wasn’t mentioned in the listing.

To the north, Mount Baker. To the east, the Cascade Mountains and foothills. To the south, Mount Rainier, and to the west, the Olympics. Anyone who has lived in Washington for some time knows what it means when we say, “The mountain is out today.” It references Mount Rainier, but I would have had to say, “The mountains are out today!” 

Our home location and the deck are a truly unique and magical place. Sometimes, when I stand in that southwest corner, I close my eyes and let the wind caress my face. I feel like Rose in the movie Titanic when she stands on the bow and exclaims, “I’m flying!” 

Taking this time each morning when I don’t Snooze it all away helps me feel refreshed and ready to start the day. On my days off, I wake up without an alarm, but I wake up about two hours after my scheduled start time. Going in that late doesn’t work for my boss, so I have to figure out how to get up without an alarm and be on time, so I don’t miss my “me time” and still hold down my job.

There doesn’t seem to be a simple answer to my problem. I have no idea how to become independently wealthy so that I don’t have to go to work four days a week.  So, I must figure out a solution.

This morning started like many others, with me making a bargain with myself to get up on the next ten-minute snooze alarm. I had pressed it twice already. I thought of that creamy cup of coffee my husband had placed on my dresser. I could smell it. Yum. I thought. You have to get up to drink it. Just get up!

Twenty minutes later, I didn’t have time to sit and enjoy another cup of coffee, but I had time to do my “Rose” imitation. I sat the mug of coffee on the café table on the deck and climbed onto the bottom rail support. I raise my arms in a “T” as if I am flying and breathe in the false spring air. I could see the sun starting its morning rise over the Cascades, and the sky was shades of deep orange and soft apricot.

It was a brisk morning, and the wind was in a swirly mood. The oak tree was giving up the last few remaining leaves to the March wind, and they danced through the air, joined by some samaras twirling from our bigleaf maple.

I reached out to catch one of the seed pods, and I leaned out a bit too far, but I caught it and myself before I fell. I shakily stepped back onto the deck and opened my fist.

Sitting in my palm is a crumpled piece of paper, not the seed pod I expected. What is this? I queried the wind. Where did it come from?

I smooth the small piece of paper and see it is a fortune from a fortune cookie:

LEARN CHINESE - GET RICH

致富 (Zhifù)

Lucky Numbers 4, 7, 8, 17, 34, 49

“That sounds like a great idea,” I snort out loud. As if I hadn’t already thought of that! I look at the fortune momentarily and remember that the other side usually has excellent words of wisdom, and I turn it over:

Fame and fortune lie ahead.

I take the last swig of my cold coffee and stare at the fortune. A brilliant idea begins to sculpt its shape in my brain. I dash inside to my iPad and pull up the Washington lottery website. The Lotto is up to $10,000,000.  No one has won the jackpot for almost six months.

“You can’t win if you don’t play!” Something says to me. 

I look around. Both of my kitties are as sound asleep as kitties can be. Lu is lolling on her penthouse perch, with one leg and tail dangling over the edge. Mags is folded up like a burnt loaf of bread on her favorite ottoman, with no legs or tail in sight. My husband had already left for the office, so it wasn’t him.

Maybe it was an old slogan for a Lotto ad, and Alexa, in her snoopy wisdom, decided to nudge me after spying on my internet search. Not to question the inspiration, I took it as a command. I ensured I had a dollar bill and dashed out of the house. 

The most accessible place to stop on my way to the office is a gas and grocery station just a block off I-5, about halfway to my work. The drive is astonishingly good today; the roads are dry. The typically poor Washington drivers must have called out sick.

I pull into the station. No cars are waiting to fill up with gas. There are no customers at the counter trying to fill up their travel mugs with the garbage the station sells as coffee; no one is vying for the last stale donut in the case.

I walk to the counter, pick up a Lotto form, and fill out the first line with the numbers from the fortune cookie. For the second line, I choose Quick Pick. I handed the form to the cashier with my dollar, and a few seconds later, he delivered my ticket. I jog back to my car, hop in, and drive towards the freeway.

I must be early, I think to myself as I pull into my favorite spot in the parking garage. No one has taken it like they often do with a huge pickup truck that blocks the whole corner where I like to sit to eat my lunch. 

“This is going to be a great day!” I announce to the empty lot and a single seagull trying to stay perched on the light pole as the wind pushes and pulls at its feathers. I gather my work bag, put on my face mask, and dash into the building.

It is oddly uninhabited. Usually, there is a line of people anxiously trying to push through the door to the check-in desk. Ordinarily, there are frazzled receptionists that I wave a friendly good morning to every day as I pass their desks dodging folks and errant kids. Missing as well are the silent masses, staring blank-faced into their devices while lounging about the waiting room. 

I wave my badge over the door lock to my department, and the door gapes to reveal a dark hallway. Now I am worried. No lights mean I am the first to arrive, which rarely happens. There are no doctors, no medical assistants, and no boss.

I run down the hall to my desk, pull out my keyboard tray, and hastily log in to check our “Teams” chat and e-mail to find out what is wrong. Nothing. There is nothing. No one is logged in, no urgent messages, no e-mails, nothing to tell me what is happening.  

I pull my iPhone out of my scrubs pocket; no messages there either. I text the team to find out where they all are. Ten minutes go by, and still no answer. I checked our schedule, and there are no appointments listed. There are no piles of patient files on my desk for the day’s visits either.

I get up and walk through the building, upstairs, downstairs, and back up to my desk on the second floor. There is no one else in the building. I pick up the phone to call security, and the phone line is dead except for the whoosh of the wind.

I decide to get to work and figure that everyone will show up soon, and my day will return to normal. 

I start on a particularly vexing issue that has me writing a long appeal letter on behalf of one of our patients. I finish it and send it off electronically to the insurance company.

I look at the time on my screen, which indicates it is 6:30 PM. I am sure I walked in at 7:45 AM, and it felt like maybe only an hour had passed after my trip through the building.

I don’t remember taking my morning break, my lunch break, or my afternoon break, and none of my coworkers have shown up. I immediately start thinking of dinner and wonder what my husband will cook tonight as I gather my belongings. I clock out and restart my computer. 

The waiting room is absent of people; there are no receptionists. I notice the lights are on in the vacant parking garage as the glass doors close and lock behind me. I climb the stairs and see my car is the only one on the top level.

I walk to it and jiggle the door. The button doesn’t work, so I dig in my pocket to find my proximity key. The only thing in my pocket is that rumpled fortune cookie fortune.

“Well, this is no help,” I say aloud to the wind that has picked up around me. I crumble the fortune, and a gust swipes it from my hand, swirls it in the air, and the fortune sails off over the railing down the street until I can no longer see it. 

Wanting to get home to see if I won the Lotto and to eat dinner, I start looking for my fob. I find that it has fallen into the RFID pocket of my bag. I fish it out and try the door again. It complies. I climb in and place my bag on the passenger seat.

I notice my lunch bag is open, and my breakfast, lunch, and snack are gone. I don’t remember taking breaks or eating my meals. No matter: I have been a bit distracted today. I warm up the car and drive out of the parking garage, turn north, and direct the vehicle towards the freeway.

I press the call button to tell my husband I am on my way. The hands-free device does nothing. I pick up my phone at the next stoplight and press his picture in my contact list, but nothing happens. The light turns green. I put the phone down and turn on the radio.

Satellite radio is definitely on my list of top things that have been invented in my life that I can not live without. I press the search button, landing on a new station called Fame and Fortune playing AC/DC’s “Money Talks.”

I wonder absent-mindedly where all the cars are. The freeway is entirely deserted. As I pass the Rest Area, I notice the lack of motor homes camping for the night.

The radio starts playing David Bowie’s “Fame” as I cruise by the ginormous billboard for the local casino advertising the $60K MEGA MONEY game. “Win A Fortune!” it glaringly flashed.

I’m turning off the freeway as Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” comes on. The traffic lights on the remainder of my drive home are green. I turn onto our street and press the garage door opener. 

Pulling into my parking spot, I notice my husband’s car is not there. I pick up my things, close the car, go up the six steps to our fire door, enter our security code, and step into the lower level of the house. Our smart home knows what I am listening to and picks up with “You Got Lucky” by Tom Petty.  

There is no evidence of my husband, the cats, and no smell of dinner cooking. I’m no longer sure what to expect after my strange day. The lights blink on as I go up the stairs, and I set my lunch bag on the kitchen counter. I walk into the front room, drop my work bag in the hall closet, and the television turns on.

I notice it's eight o’clock. The Lotto draw is now being televised. I stand in front of the gas fireplace with the TV mounted above it and step back a bit to watch. The fire kicks on, and its pretty blue flames begin gyrating mesmerizingly.

The first ball exits the chute: 4.

Then, the following number is: 7.

The third is announced: 8.

Then four arrives: 17.

Trailed by: 34.

Lastly: 49.

The house starts playing “Wind of Change” by Scorpions. My mind whirls, dizziness overcomes me, and my ears fill with the roaring of a hurricane. I reach behind to find the couch, fall into the seat, and dig in my pocket for the ticket. The numbers on my ticket and the screen are the same.

I have won over ten million dollars. Thinking this calls for a celebration, I stumble to the refrigerator, pull open the door, and gawk. It is filled with bottles of champagne. I clutch one and fumble in the cabinet for a crystal champagne flute.

I walk through the dining room to the sliding glass door and onto the deck. With trembling hands, I pop the cork and fill my glass with golden bubbles. As I take a sip, I see a small, crumpled piece of paper land at my feet. It looks eerily familiar.

I bend over to pick it up as a gust of wind blows it out of my reach and off the deck. The wind swirls the paper up and over the house's roof and into the dark sky. I wonder where it is going and if it will bring someone else the good luck it did for me today.

The alarm clock clicks on and begins playing “She Works Hard for the Money” by Donna Summers. I roll over and start to press snooze, but instead press stop, get out of bed, and head for the coffee pot. Alexa starts playing “Against the Wind” by Bobby Seger & The Silver Bullet Band. I get this fantastic idea. I turn around, yank the cord to the alarm clock from the wall, and toss it into the trash. 

“Alexa,” I command. “Set an alarm Monday for 6 AM to play The Bangles’ ‘Manic Monday.’ Tuesday should be ‘Tuesday Morning’ by the Pogues. Then, queue up ‘Wednesday’ by Harriette. On Thursday, set ‘Thursday’s Child’ by David Bowie, and Friday,” I continued, “will be Loverboy’s ‘Working for the Weekend.’”","As I stand on the deck, sipping champagne and basking in my newfound fortune, a strange sensation washes over me. The wind picks up, and the air feels charged with an electric energy. I glance around, feeling a sudden unease. The house, the deck, the view—all seem slightly off, as if I’m seeing them through a distorted lens.

I shake my head, trying to clear the fog. Maybe it’s the excitement, or perhaps the champagne on an empty stomach. I decide to go inside and sit down. As I turn to slide the door open, I notice something peculiar. The door handle is different—sleeker, more modern. I pause, my hand hovering over it, and then pull it open.

The interior of the house is unrecognizable. The furniture is luxurious, the walls adorned with expensive art. My heart races. Did I walk into the wrong house? But no, this is my home. I step inside, my footsteps echoing in the vast, opulent space.

“Hello?” I call out, my voice trembling. There’s no response. I walk through the rooms, each more lavish than the last. My mind struggles to comprehend what I’m seeing. How could everything change so drastically in a matter of minutes?

I reach the living room and see a large, ornate mirror hanging above the fireplace. I approach it, my reflection coming into view. But it’s not my reflection. The woman staring back at me is older, her face lined with age and worry. Her eyes, though, are unmistakably mine.

I stumble back, my breath catching in my throat. What is happening? I look around, desperate for answers. On the coffee table, I see a newspaper. The date reads March 15, 2043. My heart pounds in my chest. That’s twenty years from now.

I pick up the paper, my hands shaking. The headline reads: “Local Woman Wins $10 Million Lottery, Disappears Without a Trace.” My mind reels. Disappears? How could that be?

Suddenly, the wind picks up again, howling through the open deck door. Papers and objects fly around the room. I clutch the newspaper, my eyes scanning the article. It describes my life, my routine, my love for the deck and the view. It details my lottery win and then, nothing. No trace of me was ever found.

The wind intensifies, and I feel a force pulling me towards the deck. I try to resist, but it’s too strong. I’m dragged outside, the champagne glass shattering on the floor. The wind lifts me off my feet, and I’m hurled into the air.

As I’m carried away, I see the crumpled piece of paper swirling in the wind, the fortune cookie’s message still visible: “Fame and fortune lie ahead.” The realization hits me like a thunderbolt. The fortune wasn’t a promise; it was a warning.

The wind engulfs me, and everything goes black.

***

I wake up with a start, my alarm blaring. I’m in my bed, drenched in sweat. I look around, my heart racing. Everything is as it should be. My husband is beside me, the cats are curled up at the foot of the bed. I glance at the clock. It’s 6:00 AM.

Was it all a dream? I get up, my legs shaky, and walk to the deck. The morning air is crisp, the view as breathtaking as ever. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering fear.

As I stand there, the wind picks up, and a small, crumpled piece of paper lands at my feet. I bend down to pick it up, my heart pounding. It’s the fortune from the cookie.

I turn it over, and the words send a chill down my spine: “Fame and fortune lie ahead.”

I clutch the paper, my mind racing. Was it a dream, or a glimpse of a possible future? I don’t know, but one thing is certain: I’ll never look at a fortune cookie the same way again.","<brainstorm>

As I sip the champagne, the wind picks up, and I feel a strange sense of déjà vu. The house's smart system starts playing ""Time"" by Pink Floyd, and I can't shake the feeling that something is off. I walk back inside, the champagne flute still in hand, and notice a faint glow coming from my iPad on the kitchen counter.

Curious, I pick it up and see a new notification from an app I don't remember installing. The app is called ""FateChanger."" I tap on it, and a message appears: ""Congratulations on following the path. Your reward awaits.""

Before I can process what this means, the screen flickers, and a video starts playing. It's me, but older, with a few more wrinkles and a knowing smile. ""If you're seeing this, it means you followed the fortune's advice. You won the lottery, but there's more to it than that. You see, this was a test—a test to see if you could trust your instincts and follow the signs.""

The older me continues, ""You are part of a select group chosen by a secret organization called The Architects of Fate. We manipulate events to guide people towards their true potential. The fortune cookie was your initiation. Now, you have a choice: continue your life as it was, or join us and help shape the destinies of others.""

The video ends, and a new message appears: ""Do you accept? Yes/No.""

I stare at the screen, my mind racing. The empty office, the deserted streets, the strange radio station—it all starts to make sense. It was all orchestrated to lead me to this moment. I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision before me. With a sense of purpose, I tap ""Yes.""

Instantly, the room around me shifts, and I find myself in a sleek, modern office filled with advanced technology. A group of people, all wearing the same knowing smile as my older self, welcome me. ""Welcome to The Architects of Fate,"" one of them says. ""Your journey has just begun.""

As I look around, I realize that my life will never be the same. The fortune cookie wasn't just a stroke of luck; it was the key to a new destiny. And now, I have the power to change the fate of others, just as mine was changed.

The wind outside howls, and I feel a sense of exhilaration. Fame and fortune lie ahead, indeed. But more importantly, a new purpose and a new beginning.

","As I stand on the deck, sipping champagne and marveling at my newfound fortune, a strange sensation washes over me. The wind picks up, swirling around me with an almost sentient force. I feel a shiver run down my spine, but I dismiss it as excitement and the chill of the evening air.

I decide to go back inside and call my husband to share the incredible news. As I step through the sliding glass door, I notice something odd. The house feels different—almost as if it’s holding its breath. The lights flicker momentarily, and the smart home system plays a soft, eerie tune I don’t recognize.

I grab my phone from the kitchen counter and try to call my husband again. This time, the call goes through, but instead of ringing, I hear a strange, static-filled voice.

""Congratulations,"" it whispers. ""You have won more than you can imagine.""

I pull the phone away from my ear, my heart pounding. The screen is blank, and the call has ended. I try to shake off the unease and decide to check my email for any updates from work. As I open my laptop, I notice an unread message with the subject line: ""URGENT: READ IMMEDIATELY.""

I click on it, and the email is from an unknown sender. The message reads:

""Dear Winner,

You have been chosen. Your life will change in ways you cannot fathom. But be warned: with great fortune comes great responsibility. The wind has chosen you, and now you must choose wisely.

Sincerely,
The Guardians of Fate""

I stare at the screen, my mind racing. What is this? Some kind of elaborate prank? I close the laptop, feeling a mix of excitement and dread. I decide to pour myself another glass of champagne and try to relax.

As I step back onto the deck, the wind howls louder, almost as if it’s trying to communicate with me. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, letting the wind caress my face once more. When I open my eyes, I see a figure standing at the edge of the deck, shrouded in shadows.

""Who are you?"" I call out, my voice trembling.

The figure steps forward, and I see it’s an elderly woman with piercing blue eyes and a kind, yet mysterious smile. She holds out her hand, and in it is the crumpled fortune from earlier.

""You have been chosen,"" she says softly. ""The wind has brought you great fortune, but it also demands a price. You must decide what you are willing to give in return.""

I take the fortune from her hand, my mind reeling. ""What do you mean? What price?""

She smiles enigmatically. ""You will know when the time comes. For now, enjoy your fortune, but remember: nothing in this world comes without a cost.""

With that, she turns and disappears into the night, leaving me alone on the deck with my thoughts and the swirling wind. I look down at the fortune in my hand, the words ""Fame and fortune lie ahead"" staring back at me.

As I take another sip of champagne, I realize that my life has indeed changed forever. But the true cost of my newfound wealth remains a mystery, one that I will have to unravel in the days to come. The wind whispers around me, a constant reminder that my fate is now intertwined with forces beyond my understanding.

And so, with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, I step back inside, ready to face whatever challenges and mysteries lie ahead."," In a quiet town where the autumn leaves whispered secrets to one another, there was a peculiar occurrence in Dr. Alex Hartfield’s office that had never been witnessed before. The clinic's walls echoed with an unusual silence as I stepped through its doors at exactly 7:45 AM, ready for what should have been just another day of consultations and patient care.

The clock on the wall ticked away unnoticed hours that morphed into a silent conspiracy against the passage of time. The halls felt like echo chambers to my lonely footsteps; I couldn’t help but feel an odd sense of being watched by the shadows. My colleagues were nowhere in sight, and their usual morning greetings remained absent from my world.

My fingers fumbled for the familiar weight of my iPhone, seeking solace or explanation through a message or call. But all I was met with was silence; the device had been swallowed by technology's void. Shrugging off this anomaly as mere technical glitches, I continued towards my office, only to find no records of the day’s appointments—a rare phenomenon in a place where schedules are sacred.

As perplexity clouded my thoughts, an uncanny sense of solitude enveloped me when I reached for my car keys and found them replaced by a weathered fortune cookie paper tucked within its folds. Intrigued yet bewildered, I pocket the message as if it were a harbinger of the day's strange turn.

The drive home was unusually silent; even the wind seemed to carry a weighty secret, swirling around me with an icy chill that no amount of satin scarf and jacket could fend off. As I drove past familiar landmarks—the abandoned billboards promising fortune, the deserted rest areas where dreamers usually sought respite from their journeys—my mind raced to decipher my current predicament.

Upon arrival at our home, a lone champagne bottle caught my eye among the array of drinks in the fridge. The message was clear: Tonight would be anything but ordinary. I had won ten million dollars! A revelation that should have brought joy instead left me contemplative as the wind's melody from ""Wind of Change"" by Scorpions filled our home, mirroring a storm within.

Glass in hand, clutched with anticipation and fingers trembling like autumn leaves caught in an unforeseen whirlwind, I stepped onto the deck, letting my thoughts swim through past memories and future possibilities. With each sip of champagne, notes from Tom Petty's ""Wind of Change"" filled the evening air—an ode to a time when the world itself seemed to shift on its axis in quiet disbelief as numbers danced before me: 4, 7, 8, 17, 34, and finally, the jackpot number, 49. The message was cryptic but pointed at once towards destiny's caprice or perhaps a whimsy of fate.

I poured myself onto our deck, where even the crickets held their breath in the growing twilight. With each gust that buffeted my home and snatched away the paper prophecy from my grasp, I felt as though fortune's tides were playing a cruel game of chance with me.

As I stood there, champagne glass poised to celebrate what should have been an incredible windfall, a hushed whispering in the wind brought forth visions of laughter and revelry that would soon flood through our quiet abode. But first, as night set, my mind grappled with the improbability of it all—the absence of my husband’s presence felt like an unspoken riddle echoing within these silent walls.

I sat there, champagne in hand, contemplating this newfound wealth and its potential to weave a different tapestry for our lives.","f p z h"
"20",20," Scar House ",20,497,"2/7/2024","When I was a kid, I thought Scar House was a colossal place for two people to live. In my young mind, it was not only the grandest house in Cape Argo but also in Cedar Ridge County. Scar House was a testament to old American luxury. The hallway was spacious and welcomed visitors with warm, ambient lighting and sleek, polished floors. Each of the four bedrooms was a sanctuary of comfort, featuring large windows that bathed the room in natural light and bespoke wardrobes that added to the bygone opulent American luxury.

The heart of Scar House was undoubtedly my Dad’s library. It was a haven for any book lover, with towering, meticulously crafted shelves housing a world of books on Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as philosophy, physics, and psychology. My Dad’s study was a quiet, sophisticated space with an antique writing desk and no state-of-the-art technology in sight. He found it the perfect setting for his creative ways to flourish.

Scar House boasted two bathrooms (one for me and one for Dad), each with a deep soaking tub and fine marble finishes. The house also had a basement, which had been left empty long before I was born. As a teenager, I had asked Dad on many occasions to transform the basement into some kind of games room or movie den. But he adamantly refused each time, giving no formal reasoning for his decision. On my final attempt to persuade him, he warned me that he would lock the basement and throw away the key so I could never ask him the same mundane question again.

As I stand before Scar House, the mirage of my youth has clearly faded. It’s just a regular, all-American house built towards the end of the 1920s. Well, I’m probably doing my old house a disservice by saying that. It’s slightly larger and grander than most houses in Cape Argo, not by much compared to the newer, modern houses that have been built over the last fifty years or so. But it is a special house, at least for me, and I admit I’m biased. It’s the house where my Dad lived until he passed away. It was also the house that shaped me into the man I am today.

This is the first time I’ve been back to Scar House since Dad’s funeral six months ago. Dad passed away after two years battling prostate cancer. Towards the end of his life, I didn’t recognise the eminent and fiercely proud Professor of Classics and Ancient History and Culture, Walter Grant. All that was left was a husk of a man who was embarrassed by his illness and wanted nothing more than to die. But in several teary rages over the phone and in person, Dad confessed that he was too much of a coward to end his own life. Behind his feeble eyes, I knew he was asking for help to end it all. But like father, like son, I too was a coward who couldn’t bring myself to help my Dad sever the mortal coil that caused him so much pain.

My heart skipped a beat as the door to Scar House opened. I had hoped to see my Dad emerge in his usual attire: a white shirt, colourful cardigan, brown slacks, and a pipe in hand. “Is this the FBI’s high-flying Criminal Profiler I see before me?” he would often quip. “Does the Behavioural Analysis Unit forbid their workhorses from phoning home once in a while?”

“I could say the same for the parents of high-flying Criminal Profilers,” I often retorted. “The phone works both ways, you know, Dad.” At that point, sensing he was as much in the wrong as I was, he would turn on his heels and beckon me inside my childhood home.

But it wasn’t my Dad who stood on the porch (being six months dead was mainly the problem); it was Mallory Knox of Fortworth and Rush, an estate sale company I had hired to clear Scar House of its contents and put it on the market. After Dad’s death, I had taken all the sentimental items I needed (which only amounted to three boxes), and I instructed Mallory to ensure the rest of Dad’s belongings went to charity. The books in Dad’s library had been distributed among a few universities and museums across several states. Some of the books were quite rare. Dad was proud of my achievements, but he did have one hang-up: my lack of interest in reading. Books just didn’t do it for me. I preferred films and TV shows.

“Andy,” Mallory greeted me, her curly blond locks, shocking pink lipstick, and tight-fitting grey pantsuit standing out. “I didn’t hear your car.”

“I parked down the street,” I said. “One last walk down memory lane, if you will.”

Mallory nodded in sympathy. “Is Mark not with you?”

“Work.” My husband Mark was a paediatric cardio-thoracic surgeon at the Wishing Star Charity Hospital in Washington.

“He’s a good one, that man of yours,” Mallory said. “Hold on to him.”

“I do try, but those pesky kids keep prying him away.” I winced at my joke; it was in poor taste, and Mallory humoured me by smiling weakly. “So I guess this is it then. One last look around the place, sign some papers, and off into the sunset I go.”

“Considerably richer, too,” Mallory teased.

“Yeah, there’s that too.” Reaping financial gains from my Dad’s death made me uncomfortable. It was a lot of money I inherited from the sale of the house and some of his more valuable belongings.

“I do have a surprise for you, Andy.”

“You didn’t find a dead body in the basement, did you?”

“No, should I have?” she replied.

“I’m joking, Mallory,” I said as I made my way up the ten stone steps to the porch. “Dad hated the basement with a passion. I pestered him for years to convert it.”

“That definitely would have added more value to the house,” Mallory’s voice brightened at the thought of earning more commission on Dad’s house. “Crying shame he didn’t renovate. He must have had his reasons.”

“Dad always had his reasons,” I said. “He just never indulged me in them. So, what’s this surprise you’ve got for me?”

“One of the removal men, Ronnie, took a keen interest in Professor Grant’s writing desk,” Mallory explained eagerly. “He’s an amateur carpenter and loves historical furniture, especially puzzle desks.”

“Puzzle desk?” I said, confused. “Dad’s writing desk was just an old-fashioned writing desk. I think he bought it from an antique shop in Paris when he was a student and shipped it back to the States. He never told me it was a… puzzle desk.”

Mallory held up her hands in mock surrender. “I’m only telling you what Ronnie said.”

“What’s this surprise you’ve got for me?”

“A laptop.”

“A laptop?” I said, less than convinced. “Dad hated technology. He was the definition of a technophobe, Mallory. You knew him.”

“Yeah, Professor Grant sure hated the modern age,” Mallory conceded. “I think he said it was the scourge of modern living and the downfall of man. Something along those lines, anyway.”

“Sounds like Dad.” I pondered Mallory’s words for a while as I stood on Scar House’s porch. “How did Ronnie know Dad’s writing desk was one of these puzzle desks?”

“He’s seen them in books and one in a museum, I think,” Mallory shrugged. “As he and the other removal guy were moving the desk, he decided to look underneath the desk. He fiddled with the drawers and the lip of the desk for a few moments. I’m not quite sure about the finer details, if I’m honest. All I can say is that you’re now in possession of Professor Grant’s laptop.”

“How old is it?”

“Oh, it’s an old boy, alright. None of these modern slim things you get.”

“Does it even work?”

“It does. It’s password-protected, though.”

“I suppose I’ll have one last look around, sign the papers, and then ride off into the sunset with my Dad’s old laptop.”

“Don’t forget the money, Andy.”

“Yeah, how could I forget the money.”

It’s been nearly four months since Mallory Knox handed me Dad’s old laptop, and she was right about one thing: It definitely wasn’t a modern, slim laptop like the ones Mark and I use. Dad’s was a clunky and chunky 1999 Raytheon Chameleon with an Intel Pentium II processor and 128MB of RAM, running an early version of Windows 2000.

The laptop had become a bit of an enigma for me. Its password-protected puzzle was something I just couldn’t crack. I tried all combinations: birthdays, family names, pet names, and important historical events and their dates that Dad had been interested in. I tried an amalgamation of all of them, and nothing worked. The worst of my problems is that the laptop now taunted me by saying I had one last chance to type in the correct password. If I didn’t, I would be locked out until the administrator entered a special key code. And with Dad being the administrator and dead, I was screwed either way. I got the feeling Dad really didn’t want anyone looking at his laptop. I still couldn’t fathom why he had hidden the laptop in his writing desk in the first place.

“The more you look at it,” Mark said as he read one of his many weekly medical journals, “the more the damn thing will continue to taunt you. Can’t you put it somewhere else? It’s making the room look untidy. Maybe put it in a box in the wardrobe, or better yet, take it to a tech museum or something.”

“I won’t let it beat me,” I snapped. “And I’m not taking it to a museum either, Mark. It’s not just any old laptop. It’s my Dad’s.”

“The old beast is driving you mad, Andy,” Mark laid the medical journal flat in his lap. “You look haggard and worn out.”

“Keep the compliments flowing, darling,” I said sarcastically. But Mark was right. The desire to unlock my Dad’s laptop had become almost an obsession. “Yeah, you’re right. I need to take a break from it.”

“You work for the FBI. I’m surprised you haven’t got one of your tech nerds to break it open for you.”

“That would be breaking a lot of protocols,” I said. “Using government assets to fulfill a personal desire is a sackable offence.”

“Calm down, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes. I was only trying to help. Surely there’s someone in the technical department who could help you. Someone… I don’t know… that might owe you a favour.”

“If you’re referring to Emilio,” I said, “Yes, he still works there.”

“Then flutter your eyelashes at him and get him to open that damn laptop, Andy.”

“You are talking about my ex, Mark.”

“I’m not saying have sex with him. Just be overly nice to him and get him to open the laptop.” Mark picked up his medical journal and continued to read. “If he can’t do it, I’m throwing the monstrosity in the bin.”

Emilio’s parting remark echoed in my ears as I examined the individually numbered folders on my dad’s laptop. “The apple didn’t fall far from the tree, did it? Your dad definitely had an unhealthy obsession with serial killers…”

I wanted to say that my Dad had never shown any interest in serial killers. He never inquired about my line of work nor what I did. He upheld a distinct separation between work life and home life. Whether we spoke on the phone, I visited him at home, or he came to Washington to see me and Mark, I was his son, not an FBI Criminal Profiler. He absolutely had no fascination with serial killers.

Ignoring Emilio’s quip, I thanked him for his help and headed straight home. I opened a bottle of white wine, sat at the kitchen table with a wine glass in hand, and began delving into Dad’s laptop.

The laptop contained twelve individually marked folders. As I navigated through them, I discovered in-depth journal entries, numerous grainy photos, and assorted news clippings.

Folder #1 contained information about Elaine Bright.

Folder #2 Franz Platz.

Folder #3 Sharon Lee.

All three were would-be actors attempting to make their mark in Hollywood in 1981. Each was found strangled to death in their apartments. The murders remained unresolved, and the press had dubbed the killer ‘The Hollywood Strangler.’

Folder #4 contained information about Carrie Womack.

Folder #5 David Edgars.

Folder #6 Priscilla Jackson.

Folder #7 Travis Cooper.

Folder #8 Elizabeth Bell.

These five were prostitutes working around the North Beach and Broadway areas of San Francisco from 1984 to 1986. Each was discovered in an alleyway, their throats slit and bodies severely mutilated. Again the killer was never apprehended, the media named them ‘The Frisco Freak.’

Folder #9 contained information about Clare McDonna.

Folder #10 William Wilson.

Folder #11 Stephanie Ruberwitz.

This trio were medical students residing in Pittsburgh’s Strip District in 1987. Found in their beds, hands and feet bound with barbed wire, they had died from gunshot wounds to both eyes. The killer once more eluded police capture, earning the moniker ‘Pittsburgh Pete’ from the media.

Folded #12 contained information about Mary-Anne Shell.

","

That folder made my world crumble. I felt the air leave my lungs, my heart stopped beating for a few moments. The walls of the kitchen closed in on me as the weight of everything I had ever known came crashing down upon me. I looked at the photo of a beaming sixteen-year-old high school cheerleader, Mary-Anne Shell. But my mind couldn’t comprehend that name. The exact same photo of the girl I was looking at stood pride of place in a golden photo frame on my bookcase. But I knew that girl as my mother, Ellen Grant, not Mary-Anne Shell.

There wasn’t much to read in Folder #12 compared to the rest of the folders. Just the one photo and several press clippings. They revealed that Mary-Anne Shell lived in Waxburg, Cedar Ridge County (sixty miles east of Cape Argo) with her mom, dad, and six siblings. Mary-Anne was the oldest of them all and also the only girl. She disappeared on June 16, 1988, as she walked home from school. Mary-Anne’s body was found in woodland near her home almost two years later, on July 9, 1990. She had died from an abdominal wound. A baby had been torn from her stomach. My body shuddered as I read the date again. And again. That was my birthday. I was born on July 9, 1990.

My hand trembled with shock as I placed the wine glass on the table. My head ached with trauma at what I had just read. My Dad, Professor Walter Grant, the man whom I adored, the man who had raised me as a single parent, a man who embraced my homosexuality, a man who encouraged me to be a criminal profiler yet wouldn’t discuss any part of my job, was a monster. He was the Hollywood Strangler, the Frisco Freak, and Pittsburgh Pete. And, crucially and cruelly, he kidnapped my mom, kept her prisoner (more than likely in the basement that I begged him to renovate for me), then raped her, and finally tore me from her womb when I was ready to be born.

“Hello lover boy! Mark proclaimed as returned from his shift at the hospital. “I’m home.”

Before I even realised it I selected all twelve folders and deleted them from the desktop. I then deleted them from the recycle bin. They were gone forever. “Emilio cracked the old bitch open then.”

“Yeah, he did,” I replied as Mark kissed me on the lips. 

“Did the great Professor Walter Grant have any dirty little secrets then?”

I closed the laptop lid. “No, there’s nothing on it.”

“It clean?”

“Pristine.” I forced a smile.

“You okay? You look like you’re going to hurl.”

“I’m fine.”

Mark poured himself a glass of wine. “The question is why would your dad leave an old blank laptop in a secret compartment his writing desk.”

“I guess Dad’s secrets died with him.” I looked at the laptop intently. “It’s probably better that way.”
","Folder #12 contained information about Mary-Anne Shell. She was a librarian in Cape Argo, found dead in 1990, her body meticulously arranged in the basement of her own home. The cause of death was a single, precise stab wound to the heart. The case had gone cold, and the media had dubbed the killer ‘The Cape Argo Phantom.’

As I scrolled through the details, my heart pounded. The meticulous notes, the detailed photographs, the intimate knowledge of each crime scene—it was as if the killer had documented their own work. But why would my Dad have this? He was a professor, not a detective. And certainly not a killer.

I took a deep breath and opened the final document in Folder #12. It was a letter, addressed to me.

""Dear Andy,

If you are reading this, then I am no longer alive, and you have discovered my secret. I am sorry for the burden I have placed upon you, but the truth must be known. I am the man the media called ‘The Hollywood Strangler,’ ‘The Frisco Freak,’ ‘Pittsburgh Pete,’ and ‘The Cape Argo Phantom.’

I know this revelation will shatter your image of me, and for that, I am deeply sorry. But I need you to understand that my actions were not born out of malice or a desire to kill. They were experiments, driven by a need to understand the human condition, to push the boundaries of life and death. Each victim was chosen carefully, their lives and deaths meticulously documented to further my research.

I never intended for you to find out this way, but as my illness progressed, I knew I had to leave a record. You are the only one I trust to handle this information responsibly. Do with it what you will, but know that I loved you deeply, and I am proud of the man you have become.

Your loving father,
Walter Grant""

I dropped the laptop, my hands trembling. The man I had idolized, the man who had shaped my life, was a monster. The weight of his crimes now rested on my shoulders. I had to make a choice: expose the truth and tarnish his legacy, or bury it and live with the knowledge that my father was a serial killer.

As I sat there, the wine glass untouched, I realized that my life would never be the same. The house that had once been a sanctuary of comfort was now a monument to horror. And the man I had loved and respected was a stranger, a phantom lurking in the shadows of my past.","<brainstorm>
1. **Dad as the Killer**: The most obvious twist would be that Andy's dad was the serial killer, but this might be too predictable.
2. **Dad as an Investigator**: Walter Grant was secretly investigating these murders, possibly because he suspected someone close to him or was trying to protect someone.
3. **Dad as a Victim**: Walter Grant was being blackmailed or threatened by the real killer, which is why he kept the information hidden.
4. **Dad as a Collaborator**: Walter Grant was collaborating with law enforcement or a secret organization to catch the killer, and the laptop contains crucial evidence.
5. **Dad as a Historian**: Walter Grant was drawing parallels between ancient history and modern crimes, and the laptop contains his theories and research.
6. **Dad as a Red Herring**: The laptop and its contents are a red herring, and the real twist involves someone else entirely, like Mallory or even Andy himself.

Combining elements from these ideas could create a more layered and surprising twist. For instance, Walter Grant could have been investigating the murders because he suspected someone close to him, and the laptop contains evidence that points to a shocking revelation about Andy's own past or family history.

Folder #12 contained information about Mary-Anne Shell. As I opened it, my heart pounded in my chest. The folder was different from the others. It contained a single document titled ""Confession.""

I took a deep breath and opened the document. It was a letter from my dad, dated just a few months before his death.

""Dear Andy,

If you are reading this, it means you have found my laptop and unlocked its secrets. I am sorry for the burden I have placed upon you, but the truth must come to light.

For years, I have been haunted by the murders documented in the folders you have seen. These were not random acts of violence; they were meticulously planned and executed by someone very close to me—your mother.

Your mother, Mary-Anne Shell, was a brilliant woman, but she had a dark side that I only discovered after her death. She was the Hollywood Strangler, the Frisco Freak, and Pittsburgh Pete. She had a fascination with ancient rituals and believed she was enacting some twisted form of justice.

When I found out, I was devastated. I couldn't bring myself to turn her in, so I dedicated my life to studying these crimes, hoping to understand her mind and prevent further atrocities. I hid the laptop in my desk, knowing that one day you might need to know the truth.

I am sorry for the pain this will cause you, but you deserve to know who your mother really was. Use this information wisely, and perhaps you can find some peace in knowing the truth.

With all my love,
Dad""

I sat back, stunned. My mother, the woman I had barely known, was a serial killer. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. My dad had spent his life trying to protect me from this dark secret, and now it was my responsibility to decide what to do with this information.

I closed the laptop and took a deep breath. The truth was out, and it was up to me to ensure that my mother's legacy did not define my future. I would use my skills as an FBI Criminal Profiler to bring justice to her victims and find some semblance of closure for myself.

As I stood up, I felt a strange sense of relief. The mystery of Scar House had been solved, and I could finally move forward, armed with the truth and a renewed sense of purpose.

","Folder #12 contained information about Mary-Anne Shell.

Mary-Anne Shell was a librarian in Cape Argo, found dead in her home in 1990. Her death was particularly gruesome: she had been stabbed multiple times, and her body was arranged in a macabre display, surrounded by her beloved books. The killer had left no clues, and the case had gone cold, with the media dubbing the perpetrator ‘The Bookworm Butcher.’

As I scrolled through the folder, I noticed something peculiar. Among the usual journal entries and news clippings, there was a scanned image of a handwritten letter. The letter was addressed to my father, and the handwriting was unmistakably his. My heart pounded as I read the words:

""Dear Walter,

I know you will find this letter one day. I have hidden it well, but I trust your curiosity will lead you here eventually. I must confess something that has weighed heavily on my soul for years. The murders you have been investigating, the ones you have so meticulously documented—they were all my doing.

I never intended for you to find out this way, but I could not bear the thought of you discovering the truth while I was still alive. I was a different man back then, driven by dark urges I could not control. The thrill of the hunt, the power over life and death—it consumed me. But I changed, Walter. I found solace in my studies, in raising you, in building a life that was far removed from the horrors of my past.

I am deeply sorry for the pain this revelation will cause you. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I have left instructions for this letter to be found only after my death, so you will never have to confront me about it. Please, let this be the end of it. Do not let my past define your future.

With all my love,
Dad""

I sat there, stunned, the wine glass slipping from my hand and shattering on the floor. My father, the man I had idolized, was a serial killer. The realization hit me like a freight train, and I struggled to breathe. The house, Scar House, suddenly felt like a tomb, filled with the ghosts of my father's victims.

I knew I had to make a decision. I could turn this information over to the authorities, let the world know the truth about Professor Walter Grant. Or I could keep it a secret, bury it along with my father's memory, and try to move on with my life.

As I sat there, the weight of the decision pressing down on me, I heard a soft meow. I looked down to see a cat, a stray that had wandered into the house. It rubbed against my leg, purring softly, offering a small comfort in the midst of my turmoil.

I picked up the cat and held it close, feeling its warmth against my chest. In that moment, I made my choice. I would keep my father's secret, not for his sake, but for mine. I would not let his darkness overshadow the life I had built, the love I had found with Mark, the future I still had ahead of me.

I took a deep breath, wiped away my tears, and stood up. I would leave Scar House behind, along with the horrors it held. I would move forward, carrying the weight of my father's sins, but determined to live a life that was my own.

As I walked out of the house, the cat still in my arms, I felt a strange sense of peace. The past was behind me, and the future was mine to shape. And as I closed the door on Scar House for the last time, I knew I was ready to face whatever came next."," Here's your narrative:

In a world where technology was supposed to be my escape, I found myself face-to-face with an enigma wrapped in plastic—a 1985 laptop that belonged to the late Jack Hargreaves, a relic of the past. The machine had not seen software upgrades since its last boot-up decades ago and it held secrets I couldn't have imagined.

“Astonishingly, what do you make of this?” Mark said with feigned nonchalance as he flipped through my father’s medical journal articles while lounging in his chair. “It seems your old man has been keeping something under wraps.”

His words sliced the monotony from our regular Friday evening coffee chat like a twist of fate no one could have anticipated. The idea that this ancient relic was my inheritance, when it had once belonged to a notorious tech mogul who vanished in '85 and left behind just an enigmatic hint at his final message within the laptop's cryptic files, felt like an unexpected turn of events.

“I guess I could be so bold as to ask you for help with it?” My eyes met Mark’s, a blend of amusement dancing in them. “Perhaps someone from your department could crack this riddle without getting us both fired or arrested.”

His suggestion was practical but lacked the flair I needed at that moment; nevertheless, he had a point. With my father deceased and no technical skills between me to solve its digital labyrinth, Mark's comment about consulting our old pal Emilio from IT didn’t go unheard of—but it felt like a gamble with high stakes.

“If you suggest that, I might have to consider your help,” I retorted dryly. “After all, the last thing we need is an interrogation by HR for protocol breaches.”

Mark chuckled, his eyes not leaving the yellowed pages of his journal as he peered over its cover. ""You're probably right; there’s no point in taking this tech treasure to a museum—it might just be hiding something incriminating or valuable.""

The files were organized meticulously by date and case number, with each folder detailing the chilling tales of unsolved crimes. They all had one thing in common – they were all victims of The Hollywood Strangler and Pittsburgh's Phantom; mysterious figures who left no witnesses or leads on my late father’s hard drive. As I delve into folder #12, the revelation that awaited me was a series of encrypted messages encoded in an obscure encryption method used by someone we didn't know existed about computers.

As I rummaged through the contents with cautious fingers and a mug of disbelief, my eyes caught on an array of names: Elaine Bright (1983), Franz Platz (1979), Sharon Lee (1982), Carrie Womack (1985), David Wilson (1976), Priscilla Jackson (1984), Travis Cooper (1980), Elizabeth Bell (1985).

Each folder's contents were a compilation of cold case files from the 1980s, featuring profiles of each victim and their tragic demises. The killer was never found, yet my father’s obsession with these cases had always been his life's work. I could sense the weight of legacy heavy in my hands; it felt like peeling open a mystery novel written by an investigative journalist.","p h f z"
"21",21," The Library in the Wall ",21,541,"5/17/2024"," I remember that there was a hole in the wall. The place was old, on the brink of being derelict. We were called in on contract work, hired by the renovators to make an initial survey and do an extermination run on any minor pests. My buddy was a surveyor, and at the time I was running an exterminator’s. I didn’t really do the kill work myself, but since Eric had asked me to come, I came.

It was ancient, pre-war I think? Fifties at the latest, but probably forties or thirties. No one had lived there for at least twenty-five years, and let me tell you, it looked it! The yard was weeds, not a blade of grass to be seen, thistles and dandelions. First surprise was when we were cutting through to reach the door.

It was a jungle, I can tell you that, but that wasn’t the surprise. We were ready for poor maintenance, but what we weren’t expecting was the mint. Yep, mint, great big bushels of it, running all around the house. The smell was lovely, it even covered up some of the rot-stink in the building itself.

Anyway, once we got through that, there it was. Probably was a nice place when it was built, but that timber was not having a good time with the damp. Hell, even the door was too rotten for the lock. You put the key in, and the door just fell apart. We just shrugged, since it made our job easier.

Inside, y’know, you’d probably think since the door was so bad that the inside would be bad, right? No, though, it was surprisingly clean, eh? The floors were a bit holey, and the staircase had seen better days, but hey, twenty-five years is a long ass time for a place to be empty. A bit too much mold to be livable, but not bad.

Anyway, left my buddy in the foyer to start his survey while I took two tanks of pyrethrin and my big hand-torch down to the basement. The house being so old, I was surprised the floors hadn’t caved in. Basement wasn’t flooded, or even damp! Saw hide nor hair of a roach while I was down there, but… well, the place was a little… uh… labyrinthine.

Heh, love that word. Labyrinthine. Always loved Greek mythology, ever since I was a kid.

Sorry, where was I? Ah, the basement. Yeah, there were a lot of shelves down there, big metal ones, full of stuff. I swear, y’could get tetanus just looking at the rust on those babies. What I was worried about was mostly that the pests could be hiding just about anywhere. Shelves give ‘em a lot of hidey-holes, y’know?

I was down there maybe… an hour? Searching every nook and cranny, and honestly I don’t know how I was down there so long without seeing the hole. I mean, it wasn’t exactly small, or like… hidden, or anything. It was just there. When I did see it, I remember I was worried, ‘cause I thought it might be in a lode-bearing wall or something.

It was big, almost door-sized, but it clearly wasn’t a doorway. Nah, it looked kinda like someone had gone tunneling down there. I should’ve gone and got my buddy, he’s the surveyor, right? But did I do that? No. Dumb-ass that I am, I went down on in myself. It got smaller about ten feet in, I had to leave the tanks and get on my hands and knees. Not sure what I was thinking, wasn’t like I could pretend I was doing my job without the roach poison, but it is what it is.

So there I was, crawling down a tunnel like some dumb toddler, when suddenly it opened up. I must have gone… maybe half a football field? Like sixty yards? At that point my knees hurt, damn. I stood up and cracked my back, then looked around. And boy, was there a lot to see!

So at first I thought it was more of the same basement, right? There were shelves all over the place, but it didn’t take me long to see that they weren’t the same at all. They had books all over them, and other things too, like loose papers and scrolls and sh… sorry, no swearing, right? Scrolls and stuff.

Sorry? No, I didn’t see any roaches in there, why? I mean, I think there might have been termites, there were some holes in the shelves and stuff. Only bug I actually saw was a moth that flew into my torch. What? I don’t know what kinda moth, do I look like a bug guy? Oh right. Well, I could kill ‘em without knowing too much about them.

Anyway, I was talking about the library. I -think- it was a library, at any rate. There were a lot of books. I was curious, so I took a gander at them. Some of them were in English, but there were quite a few in other languages. I think I saw some Greek in there, definitely some Latin, and some Japanese, or Chinese or something. I don’t know, I couldn’t read them.

What I could read was mostly philosophy, science and other intellectual things. Theater, I think I saw a Shakespeare and a ‘Molière’. Again with the look! Just ‘cause I’m a working man doesn’t mean I don’t know nothing. Anyway, there was nothing remotely new. I think the most recent thing I saw down there was The Secret Garden.

Love that book. My mom used to read it to me when I was small. Wasn’t the most well kid myself, so I felt a real… kinship? Yeah, kinship with Colin, the sick boy. I wanted a friend like Mary. Named my daughter Mary. Told my wife it was after the blessed virgin, but begging her pardon, it was more for little miss Lennox.

So yeah, when I saw the book, I was kinda entranced. It was a weird coincidence, right? But I guess it’s not, like, the most unlikely book to find in an old library. Still, it was weird. So I took it off the shelf and opened it up. There wasn’t even any dust on it! Good thing, too, I’m not the best with dust. Sneeze something terrible.

The book was old, and I was kinda afraid to hurt it, so I turned the pages like really slowly. That was how I noticed the publication date, 1911. That’s when it came out! It was a first edition. I was like, holy crap! I’ve got real history in my hands, right? I looked at a couple other books, and sure, they were old, like some of them were handwritten, like the Shakespeare and stuff, but there weren’t any first editions apart from The Secret Garden.

It was like fate almost, my favorite book when I was a kid, a first edition and all. Mary was three, and I wanted to start reading longer things to her, and I’d thought about The Secret Garden as an option, and boom! There it was, on a job.

I didn’t want to just take it though. I mean, this was clearly someone’s collection, so I snooped about a bit more to see if I could find an exit. I figured anyone with a library like this had to be wealthy, right? Maybe I could trade some exterminator work for the book, or hey, I knew some construction guys that could patch the hole in the wall. I figured they’d be grateful for that, at least!

But I tell you, I couldn’t find a single exit! It was super strange, the place must have been huge, but no matter what, there was not a sign of any kind of door or staircase or what-have-you. I must have gotten turned around a lot though, ‘cause I kept finding the hole again. It was a bit creepy, to tell the truth. It was very quiet in there, and dark, of course. There were no lights or candles or anything, just the shelves with the books in ‘em.

In the end I threw in the towel. The place was so big, it wasn’t as if no one would know about it… why are you asking about that again? I told you, just a moth… yes, just one. Can I finish the story now, please? What? Har-har, very funny. Fine, may I finish the story?

Let’s see… right, it wasn’t as if it could be secret or anything. It was probably some rich folk’s private library. Now, I’m no thief, so even though it was painful, I put the book back and I left out the hole.

Now here’s the real strange part. When I got back, I realized I must have been gone a while, and I was kicking myself over having left Eric to do all the work while I was mucking about in a library. So as soon as I could stand up I started running. Must’ve been about then that I missed the pyrethrin, ‘cause I don’t remember seeing it after that.

At any rate, I got out of the hole and rushed up the stairs. I was full out of breath when I got back to the foyer. Eric was still there, and when I apologized for being so long, he gave me a funny look. We joke around a lot, him and me, I mean, what buddies don’t? But I’m not the joking type when I’m at work, and that was how he took my apology. As a joke, one he didn’t get.

Y’see, while I was sure, certain! I’d swear on my mom’ s grave I was down there a good hour or two, Eric told me I was only gone ten minutes. I didn’t believe him at first, but he showed me the time, and sure enough we’d been there maybe twenty minutes total, half of which was spent hacking at weeds and mint.

So I took him down to the basement to show him the library, asking him as we went if he knew where it might be. It hadn’t occurred to me at the time, but the house wasn’t the most central. It was a little ways off one of the old highways, all by itself in the middle of nowhere. The only reason the renovators had bought it was because the land around it had been got by developers, and they wanted something to sell.

Why they didn’t just tear it down, I don’t know. Regardless, he didn’t know about a library, or even another house anywhere out there, so wherever the hole lead must have been part of the property. He was none too pleased about that. The renovators didn’t say a thing about a library, and surely they must have known, right?

","

Only, when we got down to the basement, the hole wasn’t there. It was straight up gone. It was by far the spookiest sh… stuff, sorry, that’s ever gone down in my life. But it doesn’t end there! I checked around the basement again, and there were bugs everywhere. I’ve seen my share of infestations, and this one was ba-ad. That was about the time I realized the pyrethrin was gone.

I wasn’t happy about that, and neither was Eric. He seemed to think it was some kinda practical joke, and he didn’t appreciate it at all. We made up later, but he was mighty mad for a while. Anyway, I had to go back home to pick up more roach-killer, ‘cause boy was I gonna need it. Luckily I didn’t live too far, close enough that Eric wouldn’t be done with his survey before I could get back, the house being big and all.

But the weirdest part of the whole thing was this: I got in my truck, and I was halfway home, when I noticed there was something in the shotgun seat. Y’know what it was? That’s right, it was The Secret Garden!

Now I was all shook up. I was one-hundred percent sure I’d left the book back in the library, even though I wasn’t sure the library was even real any more. It must have been though, cause I sure as hell didn’t buy a first edition of The Secret Garden on exterminator pay.

So there it was, the book I’d wanted for my little girl. Well, I said three hail Marys’ and chalked it up to a bit of a hallucination. I mean, there were a bunch of shelves down in that basement, maybe I just thought I’d seen a library. I must’ve found the book there.

Well, I’m not a thief, but I couldn’t bear to leave it in that basement. I figured, no-one’s gonna be missing it, the previous owners being dead and gone, so I took it, and I left it at home.

What else? Oh yeah, there was one more weird thing: when I got back to the house with more pyrethrin, the mint was all gone, except what we’d cut. I was sure that it had surrounded the whole place, but I must’ve been wrong, huh? I worked long hours back then, way too long. I was tired as hell, and I must’ve been seeing things.

Anyway, that’s the end of the story. Why’d you want to hear it? You putting it in the paper or something? If you do, leave my name off it- this whole thing’s embarrassing. The mint we cut? I took a bit, Eric took the rest. It was mighty strong stuff, I tell you what, it could ring your head like a bell if you put it in tea. Oh, you need a surveyor? Here’s his card, tell him I sent you, he’ll give you a good deal.

Well if that’s all, ma’am, I’ll take my leave. What’s that? Mary? Oh, right, I read the book to her, she really likes it. We’re teaching her to read with it. Whatever miracle preserved it in that stink-pit, I’m grateful. It’s made my little girl very happy. ","We reached the basement, and I led Eric to the hole. I was eager to show him the library, to prove I wasn’t losing my mind. But when we got there, the hole was gone. The wall was solid, no sign of any tunnel or disturbance. I stared at it, dumbfounded, while Eric gave me a look that was half concern, half amusement.

""Are you sure you weren't dreaming, buddy?"" he asked, clapping me on the shoulder.

I shook my head, insisting that I had been down there, that I had seen the books, the shelves, everything. But the more I talked, the more ridiculous it sounded, even to me. Eric shrugged and went back to his survey, leaving me standing there, feeling like a fool.

I decided to drop it. Maybe I had imagined it, or maybe there was some trick to finding the hole that I had missed. Either way, I had a job to do, and I couldn't waste any more time on wild goose chases. I grabbed my tanks and torch and got back to work.

We finished up the survey and extermination without any further incidents. As we were packing up to leave, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I glanced back at the house, half-expecting to see someone peering out from one of the windows, but there was nothing. Just the old, decrepit building, standing silent and still.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the library, about the books, about The Secret Garden. I decided to go back the next day, alone. I had to know if it was real or if I was losing my mind.

I arrived early in the morning, before anyone else was around. I made my way through the weeds and mint, into the house, and down to the basement. I searched every inch of the wall where the hole had been, but it was solid. No sign of any tunnel.

Frustrated, I turned to leave, and that was when I saw it. A small, leather-bound book lying on the floor, right where the hole had been. I picked it up, my hands trembling. It was The Secret Garden, the same first edition I had seen in the library.

I opened it, and there, on the first page, was a handwritten note:

""To Mary, with love. May you always find your way back to the garden.""

My heart pounded in my chest. I looked around, but there was no one there. Just the silent, empty basement. I clutched the book to my chest and hurried out of the house, not daring to look back.

As I drove away, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been given a gift, a second chance. I didn't know who had left the book for me, or how they knew about my daughter, but I was grateful. I would read it to her, just like my mother had read it to me, and maybe, just maybe, we would find our way back to the garden together.","<brainstorm>

Eric and I went back down to the basement, and I led him to the hole. To my surprise, it was gone. The wall was solid, no sign of any tunnel. I was flabbergasted, but Eric just laughed it off, thinking I was pulling his leg. I insisted, but he just shook his head and went back to his survey.

Frustrated, I decided to take a closer look at the wall. As I ran my hands over the surface, I felt a slight vibration. Suddenly, the wall shimmered and the hole reappeared. Eric's eyes widened in shock. ""What the hell?"" he muttered.

We both crawled through the tunnel, and sure enough, it opened up into the library. Eric was speechless, taking in the sight of the ancient books and scrolls. ""This is incredible,"" he whispered.

As we explored, we found a small, ornate box on one of the shelves. Inside was a letter, written in elegant script. It read:

""To whom it may concern,

This library is a sanctuary of knowledge, preserved through time by the enchantments placed upon it. Only those with a pure heart and a genuine love for learning may find it. If you are reading this, you have been deemed worthy.

Eric and I exchanged glances, realizing the significance of what we had found. The library was a gift, a hidden trove of wisdom meant for those who could appreciate it. We decided to keep its existence a secret, to protect it from those who might exploit it.

As we left the basement, the hole disappeared once more, leaving no trace. We knew we had stumbled upon something extraordinary, and it was our duty to honor Eleanor Hawthorne's legacy.

From that day on, I felt a sense of purpose. I began reading to Mary from The Secret Garden, sharing the magic of the story with her. And every now and then, Eric and I would return to the house, knowing that the library was waiting for us, a timeless sanctuary of knowledge and wonder.

“Where’s this hole you were talking about?” Eric asked, a hint of irritation in his voice.

“It was right here,” I insisted, running my hands over the wall. “I swear, it was here.”

Eric shook his head. “Maybe you need a break. Let’s finish up and get out of here.”

I couldn’t let it go. I spent the rest of the day distracted, my mind racing with questions. How could a hole that big just disappear? And what about the library? I knew what I saw.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about the library, the books, and The Secret Garden. I decided to go back. I had to know if it was real or if I was losing my mind.

I returned to the house alone, flashlight in hand. The basement was just as we left it, but the wall was still solid. I searched every inch, looking for any sign of the hole. Nothing.

Frustrated, I sat down on the cold floor, my back against the wall. That’s when I felt it—a slight give, like a hidden door. I pushed harder, and the wall swung open, revealing the tunnel.

I crawled through, my heart pounding. When I reached the library, it was just as I remembered. The shelves, the books, everything. I went straight to The Secret Garden and pulled it off the shelf. This time, I wasn’t leaving without it.

As I turned to leave, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before—a small, ornate box on one of the shelves. Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it. Inside was a letter, yellowed with age. It was addressed to me.

My hands trembled as I unfolded the letter. The handwriting was elegant, almost otherworldly. It read:

“Dear Finder,

If you are reading this, you have discovered the hidden library. This place is a sanctuary for lost knowledge, a refuge for those who seek the truth. But be warned, it is also a trap. The moment you took the book, you became part of its story. You can never leave.

Welcome to your new home.

Sincerely,
The Keeper”

I felt a chill run down my spine. I looked around, the walls seemed to close in on me. I tried to leave, but the tunnel was gone. The library had become my prison.

In the distance, I heard a faint whisper, like the rustling of pages. The books were watching, waiting. I was trapped, just another story in the hidden library.

And that’s when I realized—the real pest wasn’t the roaches or the termites. It was me."," The narrator woke up from a dream and found himself pondering the events of his past. He had just finished reading ""The Secret Garden"" to his daughter and was feeling inspired by the book's themes and decided to read it out loud with her. However, in a rush, he accidentally left the book behind on the library table. This incident occurred during a busy day at work when he was working on some reports for an important client.

The next morning, as he made his way back home from the library, he realized that he had been gone for more than twenty minutes and he hadn't heard any alarms or noticed anything out of place. It seemed as if nothing was amiss, except for the fact that he could not locate the book on his desk in the library.

The narrator couldn't help but find it odd that a first edition of ""The Secret Garden"" would be found in an old house being remodeled by renovators. He and Eric, who worked together, decided to investigate further. They discovered that the house was indeed located near a freeway on the outskirts of town, far from any other houses or buildings.
 
As they delved deeper into their investigation, they uncovered some disturbing information about the previous owners and their connection to the library book. The book had actually been stolen by someone who wanted revenge for a personal grudge against one of the previous occupants of the house. This revelation sent shockwaves through Eric and his team as they realized that the incident with the hole in the wall was no mere coincidence but part of a larger, more sinister plan to frame the narrator for stealing the book.
 
Intrigued by this discovery, they dug deeper into the history of the house and its previous occupants. They found out that it used to be owned by an eccentkee who was rumored to have hidden a treasure somewhere within the property. The two men became obsessed with finding the hidden riches but were unsuccessful in their attempts, ultimately leading them down a path of danger and deception as they attempted to solve the mystery behind the missing book and the strange happenings around it.
 
As the story unfolds, the narrator becomes entangled in a web of deceit, greed, and manipulation, with each chapter revealing more layers of corruption within their small town. With every turn of events leading to the discovery that the library book was just one piece of the puzzle in an intricate web of secrets and lies.
 
The story continues as they unravel a series of cryptic clues, hidden messages left behind by the previous owner, all pointing towards the secret chamber beneath the house, supposedly holding the long-lost treasure. However, their investigation is not without its dangers as they face unexpected twists and turns that challenge their investigative skills.

In a town where everyone knows your name but no one ever really talks to you, it’s never easy for outsiders to get close enough to the locals to learn what’s really going on in people's lives. But when you come to live and work in this small community, they become unlikely allies, not only against each other but also with one another as they navigate through suspicion, deceitful neighbors, hidden motives, and a race against time before the town’s darkest secret is revealed.

As their investigation continues, the two men find themselves in perilous situations involving old rivalries, blackmailers, and even more unexpected characters from different times and places – like the suspicious librarian who had her own agenda or a vengeful ghost with unfinished business that needs to be dealt with.

But as they delve into this treasure hunt, the story takes an unexpected turn when one of them is revealed to have been murdered in cold blood, making it even more apparent that there’s more than meets the eye for what lies beneath the floorboards and dusty shelves: a dark secret. A hidden room filled with ancient relics and an enigmatic diary containing clues about its hiding place.
 
As they delve further into their hunt, they begin to discover that the book in question is just the tip of the iceberg. With each clue leading them closer to the truth, they find themselves fighting not only for a priceless treasure but also unearthing long-buried secrets about the town's past and its people.

As they progress further, it becomes clear that they are up against some of the most powerful individuals in the history of Greenwood Falls: an underground society seeking to protect the library book for their own interests. With each page turned, the plot thickens with more than one secret lurking beneath the surface, threatening not only their friendship but also testing it's your name off as they delve deeper into the hidden past of this sleepy town and its dark underbelly.
 
But in a world where everyone knows your name but no one ever really talks to you, there was something odd about the small-minded, close-knit community that seemed too good to be true. It's never easy for strangers to get inside enough information to uncover the town's dark underbelly and its secrets.
 
Eric takes a while, but he had been gone for more than twenty minutes, so I assumed everything was fine in his house with no alarms sounding or anything out of place? That is, until they stumbled upon an ancient legend about the property - this one-of-a-kind.","p z h f"
"22",22," Pier 33 ",22,102,"5/17/2024","

Hannah hated to admit how good she felt in the dress. The fabric, the cut, the draping, it all exuded richness. And the way people looked at her, with some mix of envy or longing. There was an allure to it.

However, someone with a keen eye could see the fit was ever so slightly off. It was the littlest bit loose at the shoulder and just a tad long at the hem. A perfectly tailored couture gown, just not for her. For her roommate, Claire.

The pochette was even more enviable to some. It was beaded and glistening with garish hardware meant to be recognizable from long distances. A purse with a waiting list, and it, too, belonged to Claire.

Hannah could never see the point of such overpriced items, regardless of how much craftsmanship went into them or how high-quality the material was. At the end of the day, the dress was just a dress, and the bag was just a bag, complete with tissues, chapstick, and a faded debit card.

She once had an art teacher who criticized her for thinking this way. He'd said she lacked imagination and an appreciation for the romance of high art. But to her, the least imaginative thing you could do was let the price of something determine how good or bad it was. 

Regardless, the extravagance was needed tonight. It was her camouflage and armor as she stormed the keep that was the art world.

She nervously turned the invitation over in her hand, the gold letters V.I.P. catching the light. It was heavy, made of metal, and, like the dress and bag, belonged to Claire. A courier had delivered the card in a black, hexagonal lacquered box, and Hannah knew that this was her chance. Claire would be out of the country. The timing was perfect. 

She felt momentarily bad about all this but remembered Claire saying, ""You just need to do what it takes and be willing to work hard. No one works hard anymore."" 

It always seemed to be people who were fully funded by their parents and had never really worked for anything that tried to equate wealth, or lack thereof, with work ethic. The thought assuaged any lingering guilt she had.

She arrived at Pier 33 and walked down to what looked like a small toll booth at the end. Two men stood on either side. She produced her invitation, and they scanned it. 

""Your phone, please."" One said, opening a metal case with a lock. ""A requirement from the artist."" 

She handed it over, and the men stepped aside. A set of elevator doors opened.

Gallery thirty-three was built by a Norwegian civil engineer known for his work designing bridges and piers. It was constructed in Norway, floated over on a barge, and installed at the bottom of the East River. Its creation was described as a marvel. 

The elevator moved quickly down a glass shaft with a view of the gallery below, illuminated in the cloudy water. It was a concrete block punctuated by strips of glass that echoed the surrounding pilings. 

She stepped into a short hallway and through a door into the darkened gallery. She was the last to join the group of about twenty. Some attendees she recognized from art magazines and society pages. Others, she assumed, preferred the perks of anonymity. 

Margo, a severe-looking woman and the gallery owner was addressing the group when her eyes landed momentarily on the late arrival and stayed there. Hannah flashed her invitation before putting it back in her bag, which seemed to assuage Margo, at least for the time being. 

""Thank you all for coming tonight. As you have probably guessed by the secrecy and flare, we have been graced with an installation by the esteemed artist Hex."" The crowd clapped appropriately. 

""He naturally wishes to keep his identity secret, so he will not be in attendance, but you can direct any inquiries to me, and I will convey them to him personally.""

A man from the crowd asked then, with a hint of incredulity, ""You've met him then? Hex?""

""Of course,"" Margo said, flourishing her hands. ""I know everyone.""

The crowd chuckled and clapped again, restrained but politely.

""Well, enjoy yourselves. Champagne is at the back.""

The gallery was dark. Only the pieces were lit, and Hannah was grateful for the cover the darkness afforded her. She was not quite ready to be confronted by Margo, the one person who surely knew she was not meant to be there. 

The art was a series of statues, organic shapes in gleaming black on pedestals with slowly revolving spotlights. At first, they appeared to be abstracts, but as the light moved across their high-gloss surface, familiar subjects came into focus. A pair of closed hands, a seed, a flower bud, a chrysalis, among others. All vessels of some kind and the moving lights made them seem alive and pulsing.

Hannah drifted through the space, catching snippets of conversation and realizing almost none was about the art. Some folks spoke what she assumed was Russian, while others spoke Mandarin, but they all seemed to be talking about money.

It hardly surprised her. Money and the art world were inextricably linked. The galleries were owned by the magazines, and the magazines were owned by the patrons. When a new artist was found, often by a patron, they were featured in the magazine while highlighting an exciting upcoming show. Meanwhile, the gallery would market the show by highlighting the magazine's appearance.

It was a pipeline to wealth and fame, and it was nearly impossible to get in without already having one or the other. 

Hannah had made her way to the end of the gallery, scanning the room for Margo when she overheard a man clearly struggling to keep his anger in check. She saw him leaning in close to a piece, examining it. 

""...Well, how did they get it then, Theresa?! If I found out you gave them this, I'll destroy you. Let's go the fuck home.""

Before the woman could speak, the man spotted Hannah watching. He charged at her, hissing, ""What are you looking at? Who even are you? I've been to several of these things and never seen you before?""

""I - I'm Hannah, I -""

""This is Claire's friend, Nick. She's our guest, so please don't shout at her."" Margo said, appearing before them.

Nick's wife, Theresa, stepped in, looked Hannah up and down, and said, with an acid tone, ""Nice dress."" As she led her husband away.

Hannah turned to Margo, ""Thank you. I don't think we've officially met -""

""I know exactly who you are,"" the gallerist said in a sharp but quiet whisper. ""Claire told me about her roommate, the struggling artist.""

Hannah was stunned, not at Margo's accusatory tone but at Claire's mention of her work to this woman. 

""She said you're frankly not very good. I looked you up, and I have to agree. It will never happen, dear. And if you think sneaking into my event is a way to find a patron or a buyer, I will personally make sure that never happens.""

Her eyes bore into Hannah, who stammered for something to say. 

Just then, the quiet was broken. ""What the fuck is this?! Is this some kind of fucking joke?"" Nick shouted.

They all moved forward to see what he was referring to. 

Nick and Theresa were back at the artwork, a dark beehive on a glass branch. The piece had begun to go clear, and words were starting to show beneath the black interior. It was a transfer of a newspaper article, presumably about him.

Long Island Restaurateur Wipes Out Nature Preserve to Expand Beach Frontage. A subheading read, The damage to the local ecology may be catastrophic.

Nick fumed, ""I'll sue you, Margo. This story never ran.""

Before Margo could speak, an elegant, older woman gasped in front of the flower bud. That piece had also begun to go clear, and text appeared. 

Sylvia Mellon, Patron of the Arts, Selling Historical City Rose Garden to Overseas Investors with Ties to Drug Cartels.

The room became hectic as the attendees rushed to see if they, too, were being targeted. One by one, they located their corresponding pieces: articles about money laundering, insider trading, secret court settlements, dismissed lawsuits, and hostile takeovers. Stories that had all been burned, buried, or bought off, all litigated out of existence—so they thought.

Hannah found herself at the sculpture of hands. It was now emblazoned with a story about the daughter of a top financier who had knowingly worked with sweatshops in L.A. and China to make products marketed as sustainable and eco-friendly. A photo of Claire accompanied the headline. 

The room erupted into a chorus of fury as the patrons charged to the door to leave, threatening vengeful litigation. But the group was stopped there.

""Unlock it, Margo,"" shrieked Nick. 

""I - I didn't lock it,"" she responded, rushing over to check.

Screens around the room suddenly turned on, and text appeared in multiple languages. A robotic voice began to speak. 

""You have been brought here to atone. You have been accused of atrocities against humanity and nature. Your efforts to bury the truth have only served to reveal your guilt. You must now answer for your crimes.""

They were all silent for a moment. 

""Is - is this part of the experience?"" Sylvia asked.

Before anyone could answer, the text continued. ""The air circulation system has been disabled. And carbon monoxide is on hand to fill the space. It will kill you silently and peacefully in one hour from now."" 

A timer appeared in the corner of each screen.

""What the fuck is this, Margo?!"" Nick shouted at her and charged forward as if to shake the truth out of her. ""Who is this Hex guy? Give me his name?""

""I don't know,"" Margo stammered. ""I lied. I never met the artist. We only communicated through email. He sent groups of subcontractors to install everything.""

""You idiot, you did this,"" he yelled at the gallerist before addressing the screens, ""So that's it, you're just going to kill us all? No, you want something, don't you?""

The voice returned. ""Nicholas Lombardi, you have been accused of bribery, coercion, and racketeering in connection with the expansion of your Long Island home and the destruction of lawfully protected land.""

Nick was silent but clearly fuming. That was more than the article had known. 

""Confess your crimes, and you can go.""

""Fine, sure, whatever, I did it. Can I fucking go?""

""Your phones were collected and have been given to our team. We need them unlocked. Please put your thumb on the pad to proceed."" A round metal disc lit up on a center pedestal. 

""Absolutely not,"" bellowed Nick. 

""All participants must agree to the release of their personal information for trial by the public, or no one may leave.""

The group began arguing amongst themselves but stopped as the voice returned. 

""Alternatively, using the provided weaponry, your debt will be considered paid if you collectively decide to sacrifice one of the other guests here and rid the world of that blight.""

The group went silent. It was by far the most tempting offer they'd received so far. Meanwhile, the artworks had begun to move. They each opened, revealing a gleaming golden weapon inside. A few guns and knives, a spray of some kind, and other less conventional means glimmered under the moving lights. 

The room was frozen as they looked at the weapons. 

""We should just confess,"" Sylvia said. ""We have enough money to hire P.R. firms to spin it.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Nick barked in response. ""You're old as dirt. Plus, I have other shit on my phone that would get me killed. They’ll have access to everything.”

They thought of their phones then, and all they unlocked. There was much more to lose.

""It wouldn't work anyway,"" Margo interjected. ""It was supposed to be Claire here tonight."" 

Hannah had been trying to move as far away from the commotion as possible, foreseeing a dark potential outcome. They all turned to her then.

""So it's her fault!"" Nick screamed, his eyes burning. 

""I - I just wanted to see the art,"" Hannah stuttered. 

""Oh, please,"" barked Theresa, getting up in Hannah's face. ""And is that why you took Claire's dress? Yeah, I recognize it, looks like shit on you anyway."" She seemed proud of herself for telling another woman she looked bad. 

""It's her fault we can't just leave,"" Nick screeched, ""It should be her.""

Another man, who had barely spoken, added, ""I'm a lawyer, and I could probably make a case for unusual or mitigating circumstances. Maybe even self-defense, given we don't know why she is here. Perhaps she means us harm.""

""What?! Wait, no, all I did was crash an art opening. I don't mean any of you any harm.""

""I could see it,"" said Nick coldly. ""She is the reason we can't leave safely. Her ‘theft’ has put us all in danger. Isn't that something like…Felony Murder? Like being an accomplice in a way?""

""I could make the case."" The lawyer agreed. 

""Then you shoot her, lawyer man,"" Theresa interjected, pulling her husband back. 

""Oh, um, no. I should remain a bystander so I can provide counsel.""

It didn't matter, though. Nick had made up his mind. He stared at Hannah like a hunter with a deer in his sight. And he already had the small golden pistol in his hand. 

He pointed it at Hannah and hesitated momentarily to see if anyone would intervene. They didn't. 

POP.

The screaming was almost immediate, but not from Hannah. It was Nick. He'd dropped the gun and fallen to the floor, his hand a bleeding, mangled mess.

""What happened? Did it malfunction?"" the lawyer yelped.

""Holy shit, his hand! I think he lost a finger!"" Theresa screamed. ""He's gonna bleed to death. We need to get out of here!""

She spun and snarled at Hannah. Then rushed over and picked up a small golden crossbow. To the screens she shouted, ""I'll do it.""

And she pulled the trigger.

Hannah flinched at the snap and woosh of the arrow slicing through the air, but the sound ended nearly the moment it began. Theresa stumbled backward a step before collapsing on the ground, dead. A metal rod protruded from her forehead just between her eyes.

Someone screamed at the sight. The few other attendees who had picked up weapons all returned them quickly to their spots and backed away cautiously, realizing they were rigged to turn on their bearer. 

""Thank you for revealing the worst of you,"" The voice and text appeared again. ""And for implicating yourselves as accessories to murder."" 

The countdown clock stopped and cleared. And then reset with thirty days and began counting down.

""You have been emailed a list of demands,"" the voice continued as the screens showed footage of what had just happened on a loop. ""You have thirty days to meet the demands and make reparations for your crimes. All properties must be listed, shares relinquished, and company stakes divested by the end of the countdown. If you do so to our personalized specifications, you will be left in peace to attempt to rebuild what's left of your life. If not, this footage and your dossier will be made public. This is our final transmission.""

The screen switched back to an image of the group and simply stated, ""Recording in progress."" As the seconds and minutes were already slipping away. 

___________

""I don't know. The message came from his verified account. He has a huge social media following, I assumed it was real, but they're like a cult."" Margo had already returned to her previous facade of being exasperated by everyone and everything, and she was currently admonishing a detective. “It must’ve been a sick prank.”

But then she saw Hannah leaving the police station. 

""Hannah! I'll call you tomorrow, my dear,"" she called out, her eyes piercing but pleading. ""I can't wait to see your work in person. It's really going to shape the art world.""

Hannah sighed and looked at her wearily but nodded. She was the one loose end, and since killing her hadn't worked, they pivoted to bribery. She knew if she didn't accept that, they'd probably try the first option again, so she went along with the story.

They would all get their due, in the end. 

Her phone rang as she stepped out onto the sidewalk. It was Claire. News travels fast on social media.

""Is that my fucking dress? And my bag?""

""Hi, Claire. Suppose so.""

""Oh, funny. I'm pressing charges, asshole, how’s that for funny?""

""I saw the article, Claire, about the sweatshops.""

Silence.

""I think you probably have an email you need to deal with, too,"" she added. ""Why don't you look all that over and decide if you really want me testifying under oath.""

She could hear Claire typing, then silence as she was reading. 

""Oh, and I'm moving out,"" she added before hanging up.

","

Hannah's phone rang again. The call took a moment to connect, as encrypted calls always do.

""In your email, boss.""

""Thanks,"" she said as her phone dinged the sound of a new message. 

""So, how'd it go?""

""Perfectly."" She hung up.

Hannah opened the file, and there was the gallery. Each guest was tagged in the footage, their name hovering above them. She sped up the video and watched as the names swirled around the room in all the commotion. Each face, in turn, looked up and at the cameras in horror, fury, and ultimately defeat.

Now that is art, she thought.","Hannah walked briskly down the street, her heart pounding with a mix of adrenaline and relief. She had survived the night, but the weight of what she had witnessed and the role she had played in it was heavy on her shoulders. She needed to get home, pack her things, and disappear before anyone else could come after her.

As she turned the corner, she noticed a sleek black car idling by the curb. The window rolled down, and a familiar face peered out. It was her old art teacher, Mr. Donovan, the one who had criticized her lack of imagination.

""Get in, Hannah,"" he said, his voice calm but insistent.

She hesitated for a moment but then decided she had nothing left to lose. She slid into the passenger seat, and the car pulled away smoothly.

""I saw the news,"" Mr. Donovan said, glancing at her. ""Quite the spectacle. You handled yourself well.""

""How did you know I was there?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

""I've been keeping an eye on you,"" he replied. ""Ever since you left my class, I knew you had potential. You just needed the right push.""

Hannah frowned, trying to piece together what he was saying. ""What do you mean?""

Mr. Donovan smiled, a hint of something sinister in his eyes. ""Hex isn't just one person, Hannah. It's a collective, a movement. We expose the corrupt and the powerful, and we use art to do it. Tonight was a test, and you passed.""

Her mind raced as she processed his words. ""You mean... you were behind all of this?""

""Not just me,"" he said, his smile widening. ""But yes, I played a part. And now, so have you.""

Hannah felt a chill run down her spine. ""What happens now?""

""Now,"" Mr. Donovan said, ""you have a choice. You can walk away and try to forget everything you saw tonight. Or you can join us and use your art to make a real difference in the world.""

She looked out the window, the city lights blurring as they sped through the streets. The weight of the decision pressed down on her, but she knew there was only one answer.

""I'll join you,"" she said, her voice steady.

Mr. Donovan nodded, his expression approving. ""Welcome to Hex, Hannah. Your real work begins now.""

As the car disappeared into the night, Hannah felt a strange sense of purpose. She had always wanted to make a mark on the art world, and now she had the chance to do it in a way she had never imagined. The dress, the bag, the invitation—they were all just tools, but now she had found her true calling.

And she was ready to embrace it.","<brainstorm>

1. **Hannah as Hex**: Reveal that Hannah is actually Hex, the artist, and orchestrated the entire event to expose the corrupt patrons. This would explain her knowledge of the art world and her disdain for its superficiality.

2. **Claire's Involvement**: Claire could be in on the plan with Hannah, using her connections to get the invitation and dress to Hannah. This would add depth to their relationship and show Claire's hidden side.

3. **Margo's Double-Cross**: Margo could be working with Hex, using the event to clean up the art world and rid it of corrupt patrons. This would explain her initial hostility towards Hannah and her later change in attitude.

4. **The Real Hex**: Introduce a new character who is the real Hex, revealing that they manipulated both Hannah and Margo to achieve their goals. This would add a layer of complexity and show that everyone was a pawn in a larger game.

5. **Hannah's Redemption**: Hannah could use the experience to turn her life around, becoming a whistleblower and gaining recognition for her own art. This would provide a satisfying arc for her character.

</brainstorm>

<ending>

Hannah hung up the phone, feeling a strange mix of relief and apprehension. She had just taken her first step towards a new life, but the shadows of the past still loomed large. As she walked down the street, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.

She turned a corner and nearly collided with a man in a dark coat. He looked at her with piercing eyes and handed her a small, black envelope before disappearing into the crowd. Hannah opened it cautiously. Inside was a single piece of paper with a message:

""Welcome to the real art world. - Hex""

Her heart raced as she realized the implications. She had been a pawn in a much larger game, but now she had been invited to play a more significant role. The envelope also contained a key and an address.

Curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to follow the lead. The address led her to an unmarked building in a quiet part of town. She used the key to enter and found herself in a dimly lit room filled with art supplies and unfinished pieces. At the center was a large canvas with a note pinned to it:

""Create something that matters.""

Hannah felt a surge of inspiration. She realized that Hex had seen something in her, something that even she hadn't recognized. She spent the next few days in a creative frenzy, pouring all her emotions and experiences into her work.

A week later, she received another message, this time via email. It was an invitation to a private showing of her work, hosted by none other than Margo. The email ended with a cryptic line: ""The world is watching.""

On the night of the showing, Hannah arrived at the gallery to find it packed with influential figures from the art world. Margo greeted her warmly, a stark contrast to their previous encounter.

""You've done well, Hannah,"" Margo said, her eyes twinkling with approval. ""Hex was right about you.""

Hannah's pieces were unveiled, and the crowd was captivated. Each artwork was a powerful commentary on the corruption and superficiality she had witnessed. The response was overwhelming, and for the first time, Hannah felt like she truly belonged.

As the night drew to a close, Margo pulled her aside. ""Hex wanted me to give you this,"" she said, handing Hannah a small, black card. It simply read: ""Keep creating. The world needs you.""

Hannah smiled, feeling a sense of purpose she had never known before. She had been through a trial by fire, but she had emerged stronger and more determined. The art world had tried to break her, but in the end, it had only made her more resilient.

And as she looked around the gallery, she realized that she was no longer an outsider. She was an artist, and her work had the power to change the world.

","Hannah walked briskly down the street, the weight of the evening's events pressing on her shoulders. She felt a strange mix of relief and dread. She had survived, but at what cost? The art world was a labyrinth of power and deceit, and she had just navigated one of its darkest corridors.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from an unknown number. She hesitated before opening it.

""Meet me at the café on 5th and Main. Midnight. Come alone.""

She considered ignoring it, but curiosity got the better of her. She needed answers. Who was behind this? And why had she been spared?

The café was nearly empty when she arrived. A lone figure sat in the corner, shrouded in shadows. As she approached, the figure looked up, revealing a familiar face.

""Claire?"" Hannah's voice was a mix of shock and confusion.

Claire smirked, her eyes cold and calculating. ""Surprised to see me?""

""I thought you were out of the country,"" Hannah stammered.

""I was. But I had to come back when I heard about the gallery. I needed to see the fallout for myself.""

Hannah's mind raced. ""You knew about this? You were part of it?""

Claire leaned back, her smirk widening. ""Not exactly. But I knew Hex. We had a... mutual understanding. He wanted to expose the corruption in the art world, and I wanted to see certain people brought down.""

""But why me? Why involve me?"" Hannah demanded.

Claire's expression softened, just for a moment. ""Because you were the perfect pawn. Innocent, desperate, and easily manipulated. I needed someone who wouldn't be suspected, someone who could get close without raising alarms.""

Hannah felt a surge of anger. ""You used me.""

Claire shrugged. ""I did what I had to do. And it worked, didn't it? Those people will pay for their crimes, and the art world will be a little cleaner.""

Hannah shook her head, disbelief washing over her. ""And what about me? What happens to me now?""

Claire's eyes hardened again. ""You have two choices. You can take the bribe and live a comfortable life, or you can walk away and risk everything. But know this, Hannah: the art world is ruthless. If you choose to stay, you'll need to be just as ruthless.""

Hannah stood there, the weight of Claire's words sinking in. She had always dreamed of making a name for herself in the art world, but now she saw the true cost of that dream.

""I'll think about it,"" she said finally, turning to leave.

As she walked away, she felt a strange sense of empowerment. She had been a pawn, but now she had a choice. And whatever she decided, she would do it on her own terms.

The night air was cool and crisp as she stepped out of the café. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight lift from her shoulders. The art world was a labyrinth, but she was no longer lost. She had found her way, and she would carve her own path, no matter the cost."," Hannah had been trying to move away from the chaos at the art opening, anticipating a potentially dire outcome. Everyone turned their attention to her when Nick accused her of being responsible for the situation they were in. The lawyer suggested that he could argue mitigating circumstances or self-defense due to not knowing Hannah's intentions.

However, Nick was adamant about holding Hannah accountable and blamed her 'theft'—which she had only done out of admiration for the art—for their current danger. He even suggested that it could be a case of Felony Murder or complicity in some way. The lawyer agreed to support him, although Theresa stopped him from taking any rash actions and instead pulled up her own weapon - a crossbow.

Theresa shot an arrow at Hannah but ended up fatally wounding herself as the crossbow was rigged with explosives that detonated on impact. The other guests, now aware of the danger they were in due to Theresa's demise and their own weapons being dangerous traps, quickly disarmed themselves and retreated.

A message then appeared on the screens demanding that the group meet certain conditions within thirty days or face public exposure of their crimes. The countdown reset with the same time limit as before. 

Afterward, Margo assumed it was a prank by someone pretending to be an influential social media figure. She didn't believe they had anything substantial at stake and thought that Hannah would simply agree to testify under oath when Claire called her out about the dress being taken.","h p f z"
"23",23," The Gassing of Hampshire Manor ",23,584,"5/11/2024","

A polite nausea rose up in Emmett's abdomen as he plunged back into the swarm of hungry entrepreneurs, investors, and politicians on the main floor of Hampshire Manor. His palms and armpits were swampy. He grimaced eloquently and nodded subtly at people who may have been making eye contact with him as he slipped through the crowd. Soon, he thought, you will all be dead. He tugged at his shirt collar, wishing he could loosen the tight bowtie that was ruthlessly strangling him.

Moments earlier, wandering aimlessly through the halls of the mansion's labyrinthine second floor, he had passed by a room brimming with hushed whispers and stern hissing. Someone had slammed a fist down on a hard surface and everything had paused. Emmett's heart had stopped while he held his breath and waited, his ear straining to capture more of the unfolding drama.

""We've been planning this for months."" A man growled. ""Just stick to the plan.""

""But..."" a woman breathed desperately.

""Just stick to the plan!"" the man roared. ""I want every last one of those bloodsuckers dead before dinner is served, is that clear?""

Emmett's heart had jumped. The woman's high heels clapped quickly toward the cracked door. He rushed around a corner just in time. Sneaking past the door again, he heard the man groaning.

""It's just gas. It'll be quick and easy.""

Now, side-stepping and waltzing through the throng of guests, he looked up at the elaborate high rise ceiling and took note of all the vents while his heart pounded. He sniffed the air, wondering how long they had. He looked around the edges of the room where armed security guards kept watchful eyes on the crowd. He was suddenly jolted forward.

""Oh pardon!"" a shrill, singsong voice declared.

He turned and had to squint as a dazzling silver dress assaulted his eyes. After a brief moment of shock and adjustment, he could finally make out the face of a delightful young woman.

""Excuse me,"" he lamented shamefully. He pictured her gasping for air, choking on a green poisonous gas wafting down from those vents high above. He could feel a cold sweat trickling down his spine.

""No bother,"" the woman said smartly. She extended a white-gloved hand. ""Britannia,"" she offered. ""Britannia Hampshire.""

The name drove a golden spike through his heart. ""Ah,"" he said stupidly while clumsily taking her hand. She rested her fingers gingerly on his. ""You're...""

She smiled warmly. ""Thank you for coming to my fundraiser. I hope you've been enjoying yourself?""

He almost started shaking her hand, but quickly dropped it instead. ""Yes,"" he stammered, his eyes glancing quickly up to the vents. Had it been her voice he'd heard in the room upstairs? He made brief eye contact with her and forced a half-convincing smile.

Her eyes lingered on him a moment. ""Are you quite sure everything is alright?"" she asked, concerned.

It couldn't have been her in the room upstairs. That woman had left in a hurry. She was on a mission. Britannia was mingling. She was roaming the crowd at her leisure. She... It clicked suddenly and forcefully in his mind. The political tension leading up to this event had been all over the news. With the recent passing of her father, Britannia Hampshire was heiress to a vast corporate empire and the company's board of directors had been publicly outspoken about their objections to this young, inexperienced woman taking the helm.

They weren't just planning on gassing the guests, they were targeting Britannia. This was an assassination!

His eyes bulged and a drip of sweat trickled down over his scalp, heading for his left temple.

""Sir?"" she asked, concerned. ""Are you alright?""

""No,"" he gasped breathlessly, his eyes darting around wildly. ""I mean, yes. I mean, I don't know."" He stared at her with terror in his eyes. ""I think you're in danger,"" he blurted, looking up at the vents again. Was it too late? Could he already see a sickening haze drifting down from a few of them?

Her eyes widened. ""Excuse me?"" she gasped.

He leaned in close. ""I overheard something upstairs. A man was very angry. I think he and a woman are planning on gassing everyone here. We've got to get out of here!""

Startled, Britannia took a small step back and regarded Emmett quickly. She glanced over her exquisite bare shoulder at one of the guards who was scanning carefully and steadily. She looked back at Emmet. ""What did you hear, exactly?"" she asked.

He looked nervously at the vents again. ""I'm not sure how much time we have."" He stared into her eyes. ""I know I'm just a stranger, but I think they are specifically targeting you. I really think this is about your father's estate. I don't know who can be trusted, but I think we'll be safer outside in the fresh air.""

She took a quick, sharp breath and held it, her gaze sweeping erratically from guest to guest. She leaned in, beads of sweat glistening off her forehead. ""Are you sure?""

""I'm sure we'll be safer outside,"" he whispered into her ear.

""Alright,"" she said, slipping her forearm through his arm. ""Let's go.""

Quickly they rushed to the entryway. Emmett's stomach was sick. He sniffed the air cautiously, wondering if the gas might already be airborne. ""Don't breathe too deeply,"" he said in a hushed tone, trying to appear calm. ""They may already be pumping the gas in.""

The doors were guarded by two of the mansion's security detail. They regarded the situation with scrutiny. Emmett wondered if they were in on the scheme. Sizing them up, he quickly played out a scenario where they stopped him from leaving with Ms. Hampshire. They had tasers, but no handguns. One was built like an action hero, the other more stubby and overweight. Perhaps if he could dodge the big guy and surprise the stocky one...

The muscular guard opened the door for them. ""Lady Hampshire,"" he said, nodding to her.

She smiled at him and they went quickly out into the cool night air. Instantly she began to shiver on his arm, pulling in closer. He took a deep breath of fresh air, letting it linger in his burning lungs. He hadn't even realized how little he'd been breathing inside. Britannia's perfume filled his nostrils, a flowery mixture with vanilla and spice that felt warm and cozy. He couldn't get enough of it. He pulled in another long breath, soaking in the fragrance and letting it imprint on his memory.

""Alright,"" she said, shuddering on his arm. ""We're safe now."" She looked up at him expectantly. ""May I know my daring rescuer's name?""

He winced and gave a weak grin. ""Emmet, ma'am,"" he said. ""Sorry to get you worked up."" He looked over his shoulder as they distanced themselves from the doors, descending the long stairs leading down to the gardens. He reached for his pocket and his stomach twisted into a knot. ""I think we should call the police, but I don't have my phone on me."" He tried to remember where it was.

""Right,"" she nodded. ""We collected phones at the coat check-in."" She raised her eyebrows and stopped at the bottom of the steps. Emmet stopped with her and they stared down at the ground. ""What, exactly, did you hear?"" She asked curiously.

Emmett let out a long sigh and shook his head woefully. ""There was an angry man and a nervous woman. They were whispering at first but he got angry and pounded his fist. He said, 'I want all of those bloodsuckers dead before dinner!' and the woman tried to protest but he sent her away, reminding her that they had been planning this for months.""

""That's all?"" she asked, raising her eyebrows. Her beautiful blue eyes twinkled in the dark and Emmett started sweating again.

""Well, after the woman had left I heard him saying something about gas.""

","

Britannia quickly brought her free hand to her mouth and twitched. Emmett looked at her, confused. She snickered, looking up at him with amusement and bewilderment.

He stared at her, his mouth agape. ""What?"" he asked defensively. ""All of those guests could be dying right now and you're... laughing?""

She stifled another chuckle and a tiny snort escaped through her nose. She clenched her eyes shut and fought the urge a moment later, but soon lost and released an unladylike guffaw, leaning hard into Emmett's hot, sweaty torso. Her whole body was convulsing with laughter as she roared and howled, tears streaming down her soft cheeks. He waited nervously for her to stop laughing, his mind racing. Did she think he was joking? Was it hysteria at the thought of all those people dying?

Finally she took a deep, shaky breath and looked up at him, her eyes still shimmering with tears. She wore a magnificently beautiful smile and his heart skipped a beat. ""Oh Emmett,"" she said. ""If you wanted to get me outside alone for a moment, all you had to do was ask."" Her lungs quivered and she sniffled, choking back more laughter.

He opened his mouth but didn't know what to say.

She smiled and dropped her head onto his arm, shaking her head slowly. ""That angry man is the estate manager, Bruce. He's always grumpy. And the bloodsuckers he wants dead are the bed bugs that were found in the east wing last year. We quarantined the area which kept them from spreading, but I guess they aren't gone. The head housekeeper, Anna, has been protesting the use of harmful gasses but Bruce being Bruce, he isn't having it."" She laughed. ""They've been arguing about the gas for a couple weeks now."" She started laughing again, snuggling deeper into Emmett.

He was dazed and disoriented. He stuttered silently to himself, glancing down at her and back over his shoulder at the mansion looming behind them. ""Are you sure?"" he asked incredulously. ""That man sounded ready to murder everyone in the house!""

She exploded in another fit of laughter. ""He always sounds like that!"" she wailed, wiping tears on the back of her long white glove. ""He's really quite cranky!""

Emmett deflated. He felt humiliated. If Britannia weren't shivering and cold, he'd leave. He wanted to disappear. His stomach rolled and twisted while his heart sank.

""Well,"" he sighed. ""I feel foolish. I'm terribly sorry,"" he mumbled.

""Don't be!"" she cried, looking up at him. Her face was bright, her eyes big and lovely. ""This was a ton of fun. I was dying to get out of that stuffy ballroom anyway."" She sighed and leaned her head on his arm again.

""You should probably get back to your guests,"" he offered sheepishly.

There was a long pause. He could feel her taking slow, deep breaths, the sides of her chest expanding and contracting against his arm. She squeezed his arm with hers and slowly shook her head. ""I'm not ready to go back."" She sighed. ""Take me for a walk through the garden,"" she said.

He gazed down at the crown of her head. Her hair was done up in a masterful bouquet of swirls and braids. Glimmering jewels were draped seductively down her neck and chest and the stars themselves were trapped in the silver fibers of her exquisite ballgown. She looked up at him and smiled, and they stepped off into the night to go for a walk.","Britannia's eyes narrowed, and she took a step back, her grip on Emmett's arm loosening. ""Gas, you say?"" she murmured, her voice suddenly cold and calculating.

Emmett nodded fervently. ""Yes, gas. He said it would be quick and easy. We need to alert the authorities immediately.""

Britannia's lips curled into a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""You know, Emmett, it's fascinating how you managed to overhear such a specific conversation in a mansion filled with hundreds of people.""

Emmett's heart skipped a beat. ""I... I was just wandering around and happened to pass by the room. It was pure chance.""

""Pure chance,"" she repeated, her tone dripping with skepticism. ""Or perhaps, you were looking for something?""

Emmett's mind raced. ""I don't understand. I was just trying to help.""

Britannia's smile widened, and she let out a soft, almost pitying laugh. ""Oh, Emmett. You poor, naive man. You see, the plan was never to gas the guests. That was just a ruse, a distraction.""

Emmett's blood ran cold. ""A distraction? For what?""

""For you,"" she said simply. ""You see, we knew there was a mole among us, someone who would try to sabotage tonight's event. We just didn't know who. So, we set a trap.""

Emmett's eyes widened in horror. ""A trap? But I—""

""Save it,"" she interrupted, her voice now icy. ""The moment you started acting suspiciously, we knew it was you. The real plan was to lure you out, to make you reveal yourself.""

Emmett's mind reeled. ""But the conversation I overheard—""

""Was staged,"" she said, her eyes gleaming with triumph. ""The man and woman you heard were actors, hired to play their parts perfectly. And you fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.""

Emmett's legs felt like jelly. ""But why? Why go through all this trouble?""

Britannia's smile turned predatory. ""Because, Emmett, you were the last loose end. The final piece of the puzzle. And now, thanks to your own paranoia, we've got you.""

Before Emmett could react, the two security guards from the door appeared behind him, their grips like iron as they seized his arms.

""Take him away,"" Britannia ordered, her voice devoid of any warmth. ""And make sure he doesn't cause any more trouble.""

As Emmett was dragged away, his mind raced with the realization of how thoroughly he had been outplayed. The last thing he saw was Britannia's cold, triumphant smile, a stark reminder of the deadly game he had unwittingly become a pawn in.","<brainstorm>

1. **Britannia's Involvement**: Britannia is actually part of the plot. She is using Emmett to create a diversion while the real plan unfolds elsewhere.
2. **Emmett's Misinterpretation**: Emmett misunderstood the conversation. The ""gas"" is actually a metaphor for a financial move that will ruin the guests.
3. **Double Agent**: One of the security guards is actually working with the conspirators and tries to stop Emmett and Britannia.
4. **Hidden Agenda**: Emmett himself is not who he seems. He is an undercover agent sent to protect Britannia, and his overhearing the conversation was staged to test his loyalty.
5. **False Alarm**: The entire situation is a setup for a larger scheme, and the gas threat is a red herring to distract from a more subtle assassination attempt.

Emmett's heart pounded as he recounted the details to Britannia. She listened intently, her eyes narrowing with each word. When he finished, she took a deep breath and looked around the garden, her expression unreadable.

""Emmett,"" she said softly, ""I need you to trust me for a moment.""

Before he could respond, she pulled a small device from her clutch and pressed a button. Instantly, a soft chime echoed through the garden, and the two security guards from the door appeared, flanking them.

""What's going on?"" Emmett asked, his voice tinged with panic.

Britannia turned to him, her eyes now cold and calculating. ""You see, Emmett, the conversation you overheard was meant for you to hear. We've been aware of a mole within our ranks, and we needed to flush them out. You were the perfect candidate to play the hero.""

Emmett's mind raced. ""What are you talking about?""

""The man you heard upstairs was my head of security, and the woman was my assistant. The 'gas' they mentioned is a codename for a financial maneuver that will expose the corrupt dealings of several of our guests. We needed to ensure that the mole would act on this information, and you did exactly as we expected.""

Emmett's knees felt weak. ""So, there was never any real danger?""

Britannia shook her head. ""Not in the way you thought. The real danger was the information leak. And now, thanks to you, we've identified the source.""

One of the guards stepped forward, holding a small device that emitted a faint beep. ""We've traced the signal to your pocket, Emmett. You've been transmitting everything back to your handlers.""

Emmett's eyes widened in horror as he realized the truth. He had been played from the start. The guard reached into Emmett's pocket and pulled out a tiny transmitter.

Britannia sighed, her expression softening slightly. ""I'm sorry it had to be this way, Emmett. But you understand, don't you? In this world, trust is a luxury we can't afford.""

As the guards led Emmett away, he couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of admiration for Britannia. She had outmaneuvered him at every turn, proving herself to be far more capable than anyone had given her credit for.

And as the doors of Hampshire Manor closed behind him, Emmett knew that the real game had only just begun.

","Britannia's eyes narrowed, and she took a step back, her grip on Emmett's arm loosening. ""Gas, you say?"" she murmured, her voice suddenly cold and calculating. Emmett nodded fervently, his heart pounding in his chest.

""Yes, gas. He said it would be quick and easy. We need to call the police, warn everyone inside!"" Emmett's voice was urgent, but Britannia's expression remained unreadable.

She glanced back at the mansion, then turned her gaze back to Emmett, her eyes piercing through him. ""You know,"" she said slowly, ""it's quite interesting that you overheard such a specific conversation. Almost as if you were meant to hear it.""

Emmett's confusion deepened. ""What do you mean? I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

Britannia's lips curled into a small, knowing smile. ""Or perhaps the right place at the right time."" She took a step closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""You see, Emmett, there is no gas. There is no plot to kill the guests. But there is a plot, and you are very much a part of it.""

Emmett's blood ran cold. ""What are you talking about?""

Britannia's smile widened. ""You were chosen, Emmett. Chosen to be the scapegoat. The man you heard upstairs? That was my head of security, rehearsing a script. The woman? An actress. We needed someone to play the part of the panicked hero, someone who would lead me out of the party and into the open.""

Emmett's mind raced, trying to piece together the puzzle. ""But why? Why go through all this trouble?""

Britannia's eyes gleamed with a sinister light. ""Because, dear Emmett, my father's empire is vast, and there are many who would benefit from my untimely demise. By orchestrating this little drama, we can eliminate those threats. You see, the real plan was never about gas. It was about creating a believable scenario where I could be 'rescued' from an imminent danger, only to be killed by my 'rescuer' in a tragic turn of events.""

Emmett's heart pounded in his chest. ""But I would never—""

Britannia cut him off, her voice icy. ""It doesn't matter what you would or wouldn't do. The evidence has already been planted. The security footage will show you leading me out here, and when my body is found, it will be your fingerprints on the weapon.""

Emmett's eyes widened in horror. ""Weapon? What weapon?""

Britannia reached into her purse and pulled out a small, gleaming knife. She held it up, the blade catching the moonlight. ""This one,"" she said softly, before plunging it into her own side.

Emmett screamed, reaching out to catch her as she fell. Blood poured from the wound, staining her silver dress. She looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mixture of pain and triumph. ""Goodbye, Emmett,"" she whispered, her voice fading.

As the sound of approaching footsteps filled the air, Emmett realized the full extent of the trap. He was the perfect patsy, and there was no way out. The last thing he saw before the guards descended upon him was Britannia's lifeless eyes, staring up at the sky, a twisted smile still on her lips."," In a grand mansion filled with illustrious guests gathered for an important event, concern grew as Sir Edward Hampshire's daughter, Lady Britannia, noticed her loyal butler Emmett acting unusually anxious. When she approached him to inquire if he was alright, Emmett confessed that he had overheard a man and a woman conspiring to gas everyone at the mansion during dinner. The targeted individual? None other than Lady Britannia herself.

With urgency, they decided it would be safer to escape outside into the fresh air rather than remain trapped inside with an unknown threat looming. They swiftly made their way towards the exit while guards inspected them thoroughly. Emmett worried that some of these people might be involved in the sinister plot against Lady Britannia, and he even contemplated a plan to evade one guard if necessary.

Upon reaching safety outside, they shared a moment of relief before realizing another pressing matter: calling the police. Unfortunately, Emmett had misplaced his phone but remembered that phones were collected at the coat check-in earlier in the evening. As they discussed their next steps and Emmett recalled what he overheard, Lady Britannia listened attentively to his account of a man's angered rant about eliminating ""bloodsuckers"" before dinner and mentioning gas as part of their plan.","h f p z"

“Rw’n bwyta eich camweddau, ac yn eich rhyddhau o’r drwg hwn.”

For one brief moment, Thomas Skillruud entertained the possibility he was experiencing a stroke. Ischemic, he assumed, owing to sporadic family history. Aside from the general dyspepsia of an evening ill-spent at the A-OK Corral, he felt nothing that he could imagine to be a brain bleed, assuming one might at least feel something snap or pop before the cerebellum burst like a Mylar party balloon. Of course, Thomas’ doctorates were in the fine arts, and Caravaggio’s Judith Beheading Holofernes comprised his entire knowledge of matters of the brain or brain matter, for that matter.

“Excuse me,” he called gently to a waitress in cowgirl drag. “Might I have a refill on my coffee?”

Annie Oakley nodded curtly.

“Hold up,” Thomas added. “I did just ask you for another cup of coffee, didn’t I?”

“Yeah, just gimme a moment, OK?” she sighed aggrievedly. As Thomas willed the young server toward the beverage station near the soft serve spigots, he spotted a more familiar face across the dining room, long and acned and nestled into a white hoodie above what appeared to be a rather overstimulated anime bunny.

Chad, Thomas registered. Chad Something -- a sophomore in his sparsely attended The Plebeian POV in the French Impressionist Era. A reasonably bright specimen, though in Thomas’ view, the quest for answers from Thomas Skillruud alone was a hallmark of intellectual acuity.

Thomas eyed the pair seated across from Just Chad. Parents, he initially concluded. As the sophomore assaulted a heaped platter of thighs and pie, the couple sipped soda and seemed simply to study Chad. Their placemats were pristine. Chad no doubt had selected this trough as the venue, and Mom and “Pop” simply possessed a finer palate.

But as Chad’s “mother” turned to scan the restaurant (sic), the professor could see she was at best merely a decade the boy’s senior. As the attractive millennial locked on the inquisitive middle-aged scholar, he abruptly refocused on his dogeared The Thefts of The Mona Lisa. He leapt as Buffalo Gal towered above, bearing a steaming pot.

“Coffee, right?” she deadpanned, glancing with an arched brow at the young woman Thomas had been ogling. “Figured you could use some decaf.”

Children are now tyrants, Aristophanes had lamented.

**

“Yeah, thought about coming over, but it didn’t look like you wanted to be bothered,” Chad Durning nodded as his colleagues gathered pads and taurine-laced beverages and filtered out of the tiered classroom.

“Visiting family?” Thomas inquired innocently. “Your companions looked a bit young to be your parents.”

“Oh, shit, no,” the sophomore snorted. “So you didn’t recognize--? No, man -- they’re just some people.”

“That much I surmised. I take it the, ah, the Corral was not to their liking. Neither seemed to consume so much as a crumb. You, on the other hand, appeared to enjoy your repast.” 

“Well, I dunno enjoy,” Chad considered. “To tell you the truth, the Wilmores are kinda like clients. They picked the place.”

“Wilmore. The Wilmore Cosmetic Surgery Center Wilmores?”

“I guess.”

Thomas blinked. “So this dinner was…transactional in nature?”

“If you mean I got paid, then yeah.”

“I’d think they could do better than to take you to a, well, a hillbilly buffet.”

“Oh, no – the food is part of the gig. They wanted their money’s worth.”

Thomas frowned. “Were these people paying you to…eat? Mr. Durning. Chad. Were these people paying you to…to do more than eat?”

**

“I believe it’s 40 SHADES of Grey, not ‘shadings,’” Saanvi Deshpande suggested, “and even so, what leads you to believe this young man is engaged in carnal enterprise?”

The Arts Department chairman did not euphemize lightly, and Skillruud frowned at the taunt. “Durning strongly implied he was being compensated to, well, eat. Copiously, it would seem. While his partners, clients, whatever, merely watched. At a chain buffet.”

“My,” Saanvi said, sipping her lavender oatmilk latte. “And you were trapped in this den of gastronomic fetishism for what reason?”

“Apollo rejected my piece on Midwest primitivism, and, of course, you’re aware we lost the Richard Schmid exhibition to Loyola. I suppose I was eating my emotions, and Panera lacked the Neanderthal gratification I sought.”

“A purely gustatory gratification, then,” Prof. Deshpande deadpanned. “I’m sorry, Tom. You have heard of gastronomic voyeurism? ‘Broadcast eating,’ or meok-bang, has become wildly popular in South Korea – solo diners livestreaming meals for thousands of viewers, accepting donations to make a living. Single-person households purportedly account for a quarter of South Korea’s population, and even a virtual dinner with a stranger might help fill an emotional hole.”

“Why do I suspect you’re still double entendre-ing me?” Skillruud growled. “This was no ‘virtual’ meal, so whatever banging may have been involved, I seriously question it was meok-bang-ing.”

“My,” Saanvi breathed.

“Oh, please, just shut up.”

**

“Mr. Durning?”

Chad nudged a huge black muzzle back inside the door as he glanced at the small woman on the damp walk below. The young man descended the faux-“townhouse” steps as the muzzle owner thumped and growled behind him.

“Oh, yeah,” he finally nodded. “I had you for Multicultural Multimedia Arts last fall. Professor…?”

“Deshpande. I I won’t keep you. One of my faculty, Dr. Skillruud, has voiced a minor concern. He’s very pleased with your work. Dr. Skillruud simply wants to know that you are all right. In extracurricular terms.”

Chad dropped to the bottom step, now at the professor’s eye level. “Huh. That’s nice, I guess. You guys always take such a personal interest?”

Saanvi smiled. “Perhaps not ordinarily. Mr. Durning, I’m aware of the financial pressures of college. On occasion, a student is tempted to meet expenses through, well, dubious means. Prof. Skillruud said you were dining Tuesday evening with clients – in point of fact, a fairly prominent local couple. If you are facing economic hardship, I thought I might see how the University might assist you.”

“Just what the hell does Prof. Skillruud think I’m doing?”

“He found your dinner, ah, meeting unconventional, to say the least. For one thing, your ‘clients’ were not dining. Dr. Skillruud believes they were instead rather absorbed in your appetite. I hope you won’t find this a breach of personal privacy, but I perused the social media, and am aware of your skills. Bar Roma in Chicago, Big Mama’s Bar-B-Q in Belleville, Tonini’s Italian Market in Berwyn -- a pound of ham, salami, mortadella, capicola, and provolone?”

“A pound each, on a one-pound bun,” Chad grinned. “That one got me some Youtube sponsorships, that and the Carlinville Haystack Breakfast Challenge. I wanted to do the Great Steak Challenge at Shiraz, up in Bloomingdale, but you had to wash the 60-ounce steak down with wine, and they weren’t bending. I was going to take a stab at it next fall. Of course, I took a shot at the Nathan’s contest at Coney Island last summer, but those guys are hardcore.”

Saanvi shook her head. “Competitive eating. How do you do this and remain so, ah, svelte?”

Chad slapped his flat gut. “You gotta have elasticity – the big boys got nowhere for everything to go. I think I have superhuman metabolism – I got banned from the Chinese buffet back home in junior high, and I thought, shit, I could make some righteous tuition on YouTube.”

“Are the doctors Wilmore sponsors?”

He rose. “Nah. I got something better that makes use of my talents and helps people.”

“This is the crux of Dr. Skillruud’s concern. Have you heard, perhaps, of gastronomic voyeurism? The sensual pleasure of food, of observing that pleasure in others?”

Chad processed that, then howled. “Omigod. No. I mean, they’re like…old. Millennials. Shit, man – did he think I was like doing them? God. Tell him thanks, but not to worry. Wait.” He dug in his jeans, and extended a business card toward the professor. “There’s no sex, and I’m not doing any drugs. And I’ve got protection.”

“Reassuring,” Saanvi murmured.

**

“FEEL BETTER. EAT LESS. CLEAR YOUR TOXINS.” Skillruud studied the sans serif type. “Sounds like some sort of holistic homeopathic diet guru. Sounds like a scam,” Thomas grunted, sawing the tip from a chocolate croissant as Saanvi stirred turbinado into her green tea.

The Campus Coffee Commune was packed with faculty and vegans fueling for the day on tempeh sausage and cruelty-free scones and rigorous abstract debate, and Prof. Deshpande had selected an isolated two-top by the alley window.

“It does beg several questions,” Saanvi admitted. “Not the least of which concern Mr. Durning’s use of semantics. If this is a diet pitch, note that ‘feel better’ is the lead, followed by ‘eat less.’ Not eat better. As if, perhaps, eating less is merely a secondary benefit of his actual service. Which seems to involve ingesting outsized portions in front of clients. Purportedly to clear their ‘toxins.’

“Then, we consider his assurance that no sex is involved, and that he is drug-free. And ‘protection’? If sex is off the table, and he and his clients meet in a public venue, what need is there for self-preservation? You mentioned Chad uttering some odd statement at the cowboy buffet.”

“Ah, yes, nearly forgot,” Skillruud nodded. “It didn’t seem to belong to any of the Romance languages, or any Cyrillic/Slavic or Asian tongues, and then I recalled reading a monograph on the 18th Century agrarian painter Thomas Barker and attempting to follow up on his family’s artistic pedigree with a gallery owner from South Wales. He had some impossible Welsh name with too many vowels in the wrong places and I believe an apostrophe somewhere in the mess. Young Durning’s recitation reminded me of it.”

Saanvi grew contemplative. “You said Durning’s ‘recitation.’ Do you recall what he said, specifically?”

Skillruud shrugged. “At the time, I was convinced I was suffering an auditory illusion. But yes, I suppose recitation is the proper term – it had a rather melodramatic tone. Like some bit of business, though what business it might have been…”

“I might have an idea,” Saanvi said. “Have you read the news this morning, the funeral notices? A local physician died yesterday in the St. Mark’s Hospital ICU. One Max Wilmore. Mr. Durning’s recitation -- might it instead have been an incantation? It would explain what I sensed during our visit.”

**

“It’s not illegal,” Tori Wilmore declared, drawing Saanvi away from the “celebrants.” The Wilmores had been generous University donors, and Prof. Deshpandi had piggybacked on The President’s invitation to the celebration of life at the couple’s Beltway surgicenter.

“I cannot see how it could be,” Saanvi told the widow, staring up at a mural of an uplifted, lifted woman of a certain age. “Sin eating was an ancient funerary custom unique to Welsh culture, later incorporated into Christianity, and it persisted into the 19th century. A relative of the troubled deceased would bake a cake and place it on the corpse at sunset as if to absorb the decedent’s sins. This is a something of a new twist. Whatever drew you into such an odd ritual?”

The surviving Wilmore sighed. “Well, you’ll probably hear about it soon, anyway. The state attorney general’s investigating allegations against us – unnecessary procedures, billing overcharges, ah, maybe some insurance fraud. We’ve been on the bubble since COVID and the economic dip, and as the state dug in, Max grew depressive and consumed with guilt. He wouldn’t see a therapist – someone in the local community he didn’t trust to keep a confidence. Then one of your grad students came in for some cool-sculpting, and told me about his unique ‘therapy,’ and I thought, what could hurt? Even if it had only a placebo effect, maybe it could draw Max out of his funk.

“I figured Chad had to be running a game, and I felt a little creeped out when he began to chant about consuming our trespasses and relieving us of evil. No pun intended, but Max seemed to eat it up. And you know what, after Chad quit gorging, we actually felt, well, relieved. Unburdened. I can’t explain it.”

Saanvi looked back to the blissfully enhanced creature above the reception counter. “I suspect I can.”

**

Thomas raised a fist for the fifth time, and finally rapped on the red door. “Son? Chadwick?”

The man from University Manor Townhomes frowned as something bumped and rustled inside. “Probably the fu--, um, the therapy animal. We have some pretty strict rules about size, but your kid had a note from a shrink, and threatened us with an Americans With Disabilities Act complaint.”

“Sensitive child,” Thomas explained. “Could you, please? His mother and I are worried half to death.”

The rental agent sighed and jammed a dupe key into the deadbolt lock. Saanvi had urged Thomas to forestall any confrontation until she had liaised with the Widow Wilmore, but his colleague’s theory had been so tantalizing.

“If you could just wait out here?” Thomas implored. “I don’t want to embarrass the boy if this is simply one of his pensive episodes.”

“Mm,” the agent murmured, already poking at his iPhone. The professor nodded graciously, and slipped inside.

Thomas’ delicate nostrils were assaulted by what he could only describe – or more accurately, imagine -- as eau de livestock barn. The arts aficionado Marco Polo-ed the scent through a corridor opening into a sparse, Target-furnished living room replete with gaming paraphernalia and a titanic flat screen and a kitchenette piled high with doggie boxes, pizza flats, and depleted Ziploc bags, toward a closed bedroom door. He jumped as the door reverberated with a sharp thump and a plaintive, inhuman cry.

“Hello?” Prof. Skillruud quavered inanely. “Mr. Durning? Chad? Are you all right? I’m, ah, I guess I’m coming in.”

Thomas’ plantar fasciitis and what he denied as gout rendered forced entry a perilous proposition. The musky, organic funk grew stronger as he grasped the tarnished brass knob and twisted. As the lock disengaged, Chad or whoever, whatever, snuffled and rumbled.

The door swung inward and he was greeted by the room’s inhabitant. Pan and Cthulhu appeared to merge in the huge black creature, which stared at him with soulless cephalopodan eyes as its thick, furred haunches tightened. Thomas was frozen on the threadbare hallway carpet as the beast considered whether to feast on or simply disembowel the Midwest’s shortlist premier authority on the Impressionist School.

“Maaaaaaaaaaaaa!!” the bloated creature bellowed before plopping back on its fat matted ass.

“The fuck is that?” the UMT site manager squeaked behind Thomas’ shoulder.

**

“I saw it in the eyes, but at the time, I didn’t know what to make of it,” Saanvi suggested, as her rattled vice chair held an umbrella over her head. At the non-collegial urgings of the Millington PD, Millington Animal Control had subdued Chad’s “familiar,” as Dr. Skillruud had dubbed it in an effort to cloak his deception and trespass in faux-mysticism.

“When Mr. Durning nudged what I had assumed to be his Baskervillean hound back into the apartment, I caught the merest glance at one of what you called its ‘Lovecraftian’ eyes. You have never really experienced agrarian culture, have you?”

“I taught that unit on husbandry motifs in the Hague School. Gerald Bilders’ Cows at a Pond evokes a particularly anthropomorphic perspective on—”

“Thank you. In the summers, my father would send my brothers and I to visit his uncle in the Palakkad district. He was a herder, and supplied local and regional markets. I became quite familiar – almost familial – with his Attappadi Blacks. Poor milkers but highly resistant to disease, and like all the caprine and uvine species, it shares with octopi and toads rectangular pupils that provide a nearly panoramic view.”

Thomas blinked away a rivulet of precipitation. “How in the world did Durning ever get that thing certified as a therapy animal?”

“No doubt one of his clients. Even mental health professionals dabble in unconventional practices from time-to-time. And in a manner, Chad’s claim was not entirely fraudulent. Goats can spur the release of endorphins and oxytocin, which reduces stress and stimulates socialization. Goat therapy has proven invaluable for seniors with dementia, those on the autistic spectrum, depression patients, and even in prison rehabilitation. I once experimented with goat yoga, and it was like a reunion with old friends.”

“I felt no sense of camaraderie,” Prof. Skillruud said stiffly.

","

“Mr. Durning’s companion provided a far different form of therapy. The young man already has conceded to Det. Mead that his ‘service’ is a sham, that neurotic and psychologically burdened millennials appear to be ‘suckers’ for fringe treatments that sidestep the need for lifestyle change or ethical contemplation. But even a cynical opportunist can harbor doubts and superstition. Mr. Durning assured you he had ‘protection’ against the risks of his enterprise. He’d perform his gastronomic ritual, then slip some mood enhancer like serotonin or benzodiazapine into the client’s water or coffee to temporarily lift their guilt or anxiety. Unfortunately, knowing nothing about the client’s potential drug sensitivities. The city prosecutor is considering a felony homicide charge in Mr. Wilmore’s death.

“Chad was a huckster, certainly. But there remained that doubt. Consuming such excessive quantities, playing with occult practices, toying with the ‘sins’ of others, likely fueled his own anxieties. So Chad sought a way to offload any psychic guilt that might have seeped in with the fats and carbohydrates. You saw the discarded take-home containers, the remains of several ritual meals. The tragic condition of this unwitting creature. The only three-way here the ostensible transfer of psychic toxins.”

“Idiot,” Thomas muttered, shaking his gray mop like a Labrador. The townhouse door opened and the animal control team wrestled an obese, snorting, coal-black ram of an unnaturally equine scale down the concrete steps.

“Incidentally,” Saanvi murmured innocently, “Mr. Durning asked Det. Mead to tell you that after he makes bail, he’d like to take you to lunch. No hard feelings, I assume.”","Saanvi chuckled softly. ""Well, Thomas, not everyone is cut out for the pastoral life.""

Thomas sighed, his mind still reeling from the bizarre encounter. ""So, what now? What do we do about Chad and his... 'therapy' business?""

Saanvi's eyes twinkled with a mix of amusement and concern. ""I think we need to have a serious conversation with Chad. But first, let's get some clarity on what exactly he's been doing and why.""

The next day, Thomas and Saanvi met Chad in the university's small, dimly lit conference room. Chad looked nervous, his usual bravado replaced by a palpable anxiety.

""Chad,"" Saanvi began gently, ""we need to understand what exactly you've been doing with your clients. The sin-eating, the goat... it's all very unconventional.""

Chad took a deep breath. ""Look, I know it sounds crazy, but it works. People feel better after these sessions. It's like they offload their guilt and stress onto me, and I... I guess I absorb it.""

Thomas leaned forward, his curiosity piqued. ""But why the goat, Chad? What role does it play in all this?""

Chad hesitated, then spoke in a low voice. ""The goat... it's not just any goat. It's a special breed, one that's been used in ancient rituals for centuries. It has this... ability to absorb negative energy. When I chant the incantation, it transfers the burden from the person to the goat.""

Saanvi and Thomas exchanged a glance, both trying to process the surreal explanation.

""And the clients?"" Saanvi asked. ""Do they know about the goat's role?""

Chad shook his head. ""No, they just think it's part of the therapy. They don't need to know the details. They just need to feel better.""

Thomas sighed. ""Chad, this is highly unorthodox and potentially dangerous. We need to find a way to help you and your clients without resorting to these... rituals.""

Chad looked down, his face a mix of defiance and resignation. ""I understand. But you have to believe me, it really does help them.""

**

A week later, Thomas received a call from Saanvi. ""Thomas, you need to come to the campus clinic. Now.""

When Thomas arrived, he found Saanvi standing outside a treatment room, her face pale. ""What's going on?"" he asked, his heart pounding.

Saanvi took a deep breath. ""Chad's here. He collapsed during a session with a client. The doctors are running tests, but... Thomas, they found something strange.""

Thomas's eyes widened. ""What do you mean?""

Saanvi led him into the room where Chad lay unconscious, hooked up to various monitors. ""The doctors found elevated levels of cortisol and other stress hormones in his system. It's as if he's been absorbing the stress and guilt of dozens of people.""

Thomas stared at Chad, a chilling realization dawning on him. ""The sin-eating... it wasn't just a ritual. It was real. Chad was actually absorbing their burdens.""

Saanvi nodded, her eyes filled with a mix of awe and fear. ""And it's killing him.""

**

As Chad lay in the hospital bed, Thomas and Saanvi knew they had to find a way to save him. They reached out to experts in ancient rituals and modern therapy, hoping to find a solution that could help Chad without endangering his life.

In the end, they discovered a way to channel the negative energy into a more manageable form, allowing Chad to continue helping others without sacrificing himself. The goat was returned to a sanctuary, where it could live out its days in peace.

Chad's unique gift was both a blessing and a curse, but with the support of his professors and the university, he found a way to use it responsibly. And as for Thomas and Saanvi, they had learned that sometimes, the most extraordinary mysteries lay not in the past, but in the people around them.","<brainstorm>

1. **Chad's True Motive**: Chad is not just a competitive eater but is part of an ancient secret society that uses sin-eating to cleanse the world of evil. The goat is a mystical creature that helps him in this task.
2. **The Goat's Role**: The goat is not just a therapy animal but a guardian spirit that ensures Chad's safety and the effectiveness of the sin-eating ritual.
3. **The Wilmores' Secret**: The Wilmores were not just guilty of fraud but were involved in darker, more sinister activities. Chad's sin-eating was a desperate attempt to cleanse them before they faced divine retribution.
4. **Saanvi's Revelation**: Saanvi has a hidden past connected to sin-eating and recognizes Chad's true purpose. She decides to help him rather than expose him.
5. **Thomas' Transformation**: Thomas, initially skeptical, becomes a believer in the mystical aspects of sin-eating and decides to support Chad's mission.

As the rain continued to pour, Saanvi turned to Thomas with a newfound determination in her eyes. ""Thomas, there's more to this than we initially thought. Chad isn't just a competitive eater; he's part of an ancient tradition, a secret society dedicated to cleansing the world of evil through sin-eating.""

Thomas blinked, trying to process the information. ""You mean, like a modern-day exorcist?""

""Exactly,"" Saanvi nodded. ""And the goat, it's not just a therapy animal. It's a guardian spirit, ensuring Chad's safety and the effectiveness of the ritual.""

Thomas looked back at the apartment, where the police and animal control were still dealing with the aftermath. ""But why the Wilmores? What were they hiding?""

Saanvi sighed. ""The Wilmores were involved in more than just fraud. They were part of a darker, more sinister network. Chad's sin-eating was their last hope for redemption before facing divine retribution.""

Thomas felt a chill run down his spine. ""So, what do we do now?""

""We help him,"" Saanvi said firmly. ""Chad's mission is crucial, and he needs allies who understand the gravity of his work.""

Thomas nodded slowly, the pieces finally falling into place. ""Alright, let's find Chad and offer our support.""

As they approached the apartment, Chad emerged, looking weary but resolute. ""I heard what you said,"" he told Saanvi. ""I could use some help.""

Saanvi smiled. ""We're with you, Chad. Let's cleanse this world, one sin at a time.""

With a newfound sense of purpose, the trio set off into the storm, ready to face whatever darkness lay ahead. The mysteries of the past had been unraveled, and a new chapter of their lives was about to begin, bound by a shared mission to rid the world of its deepest evils.

","Saanvi chuckled softly. ""Well, Thomas, not all goats are created equal. And certainly not all are meant for therapy.""

Thomas sighed, his mind still reeling from the bizarre encounter. ""So, what now? What do we do about Chad and his... familiar?""

Saanvi's expression grew serious. ""We need to understand the full extent of what Chad is involved in. The sin-eating ritual, the incantations, the presence of that creature—it all points to something far more ancient and esoteric than mere competitive eating or therapy animals.""

Thomas nodded, feeling a chill despite the umbrella shielding him from the rain. ""Do you think Chad is aware of what he's truly doing?""

""Hard to say,"" Saanvi replied. ""But we need to find out. And we need to do it carefully. If he's unwittingly involved in something dangerous, we have to help him. If he's aware and complicit, then we need to stop him.""

**

The next day, Thomas and Saanvi arranged to meet Chad at a neutral location—a quiet café near the university. Chad arrived, looking more relaxed than Thomas had ever seen him. He greeted them with a broad smile and a firm handshake.

""Hey, Professors. What's up?"" Chad asked, taking a seat.

""Chad, we need to talk about your... extracurricular activities,"" Saanvi began, choosing her words carefully.

Chad's smile faltered slightly. ""Oh, that. Look, I know it sounds weird, but it's really not a big deal. It's just a way to make some extra cash and help people feel better.""

""Chad, we found your 'therapy animal,'"" Thomas interjected. ""That creature is not a dog. It's a goat. And not just any goat—it's something far more sinister.""

Chad's eyes widened in surprise. ""You found Baphy? How did you—""

""Baphy?"" Saanvi interrupted. ""As in Baphomet? Chad, do you understand the implications of what you're doing?""

Chad looked genuinely confused. ""Baphomet? No, it's just a name I came up with. I didn't know it meant anything.""

Saanvi leaned forward, her voice gentle but firm. ""Chad, the rituals you're performing, the incantations—these are not harmless. They have deep, ancient roots. You're invoking something you don't understand.""

Chad's face paled. ""I... I didn't know. I thought it was just a way to help people, to take away their guilt and pain.""

Thomas placed a reassuring hand on Chad's shoulder. ""We believe you, Chad. But you need to stop. Whatever you're doing, it's dangerous. For you and for those you're trying to help.""

Chad nodded slowly, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and determination. ""Okay. I'll stop. I don't want to hurt anyone.""

**

As they left the café, Thomas and Saanvi exchanged a relieved glance. They had managed to avert a potential disaster, but the mystery was far from over. They still needed to understand the full extent of the rituals and the true nature of the creature Chad had unwittingly summoned.

Later that evening, as Thomas sat in his study, he couldn't shake the feeling that they had only scratched the surface. The ancient words Chad had spoken echoed in his mind, and he knew that their journey into the unknown was just beginning.

And somewhere, in the shadows, Baphy watched and waited, its soulless eyes gleaming with a malevolent intelligence."," Saanvi Wilmore's keen intellect immediately sensed an underlying issue as she glanced at the mural depicting the age-old Welsh sin eating custom, a practice where relatives would bake cakes and place them on corpses to absorb sins—a tradition that had lingered well into the 19th century. The Wilmores' adoption of such an unusual ritual piqued her curiosity.

Tori Wilmore explained to Saanvi how their son, Max, had fallen into a state of despair following his father's demise and amidst economic hardship exacerbated by the pandemic. In search of unconventional methods to help him cope, they turned to Chadwick Skillruud—a graduate student known for his ""therapy"" that included a bizarre chanting ritual involving sin consumption.

The Wilmores had invited Saanvi and her team under the guise of being generous donors to the university where Chad studied, but it soon became apparent that there was more to their story. The state attorney general's office had begun investigating the couple on charges including unnecessary medical procedures, overcharging patients, and potential insurance fraud.

As Saanvi delved deeper into the situation, she realized the complexities of grief, guilt, and desperation that can drive individuals to seek solace in the most unconventional practices. She understood that while Chad's methods were not scientifically validated or ethically sound, they provided a temporary reprieve for those who felt lost and vulnerable.

When Saanvi confronted the Wilmores with her findings, Tori admitted to her desperation but also expressed gratitude for the relief it brought Max during his darkest times. She acknowledged that she had been naive in her understanding of therapy animals and practices outside of academia. The ""goat"" they had welcomed into their home was not a certified animal, but rather an escaped pet store goat named Pan, who became a source of comfort for Max through the release of endorphins and oxytocin during their sessions.

Tori also confessed that she hadn't understood the potential theraeutic effects of caprine therapy beforehand and had been too quick to judge Chad's methods without considering the psychological benefits they might hold for those in need, especially under extraordinary circumstances like a global pandemic.","p h z f"
"25",25," The Pi Day Pie Baking Contest ",25,603,"6/19/2024","If pi is an irrational number, does that make pie bakers irrational too? Jasmine certainly believed so, as she eyed the other bakers swirling around the church auditorium. Irrational maybe, but not ghosts, though somehow her dead Grandma had come back from the grave to enter her famous strawberry rhubarb pie.

The Pi Day Pie Baking contest didn’t have many rules, the entries just had to be round, homemade and with a pastry bottom. Jasmine Dumas walked along the long tables looking at the competition, the entries glowing under the fluorescent lights.

Round mini sweet potato pies sparkled in their cling film wrapping, next to glistening lemon meringue. The key lime pie’s sugary edges shined in its thick black pie tin. So many pies! She saw pumpkin, pecan and berry, alongside apple, key lime and cherry, but she caught her breath at the strawberry rhubarb.

The pie was unmistakable. The lattice top crust had been intricately woven together from delicate ribbons of pastry strands, each one edged with a serrated cutter, to create a gorgeous golden web. Jasmine had tried to copy it, but had never seen another pie crust like it, except in her Grandma's kitchen.

There could be no question, this pie could only have been made by one person, her Grandma, now 5 years dead

Jasmine normally wouldn’t care too much about a pie competition, she specialized in cupcakes. Who cares who makes the better pie, if they all taste good? But this contest was special. It came with a check for $3,141.59, the first 6 digits of pi, and almost exactly the down payment on the food truck she had her eye on.

With that money, along with the baking equipment, bags of flour and sugar she had stacked up like a warehouse in the extra bedroom of her small apartment, she could finally take her obsession, and new career on the road. After a trademark lawsuit, she needed a new name though, maybe Engineered Cupcakes?

Though specializing in cupcakes, Jasmine had a secret weapon for this contest, a sure-fire winner. Jasmine had seen her Grandma’s prize ribbons, and just knew it would win this contest too. She had the best, most fantastic recipe for a strawberry rhubarb pie.

Jasmine and her cousin found the recipe and many more, in a box in her Grandma’s kitchen, all in an unfamiliar cursive, carefully written out by her great-Grandma, or maybe great-great-Grandma! Generations of love, and baking, now in her hands.    

 Except she was looking at the real thing right here in front of her. She turned quickly to see her own entry at the far end of the table, number 75, its own delicate crust secure on the blue glass pie plate.

How could someone else make her Grandma's pie!

A betrayal of the worst sort and she knew who it was, who it had to be, the only other person who had access to her Grandma’s secret recipe, her cousin Jane.

Jasmine scanned the crowd, eyes glowering as she looked for Jane’s distinctive pink-dyed hair. She must be hiding! Jasmine needed to find her cousin, but until then, she had to get this other, imposter pie off the judges table.

 “Oh I dropped my brooch.” Jasmine exclaimed out loud to no one, and then with a dramatic gesture, bent down on one knee to pull back the plastic tablecloth searching for a box, a bag, anything to hide this fake. 

When a loud voice squawking out from a crackling speaker announced the last call for the contest, Jasmine took her chance, grabbed a pink cardboard box and had the pie in it in just seconds.

She would move Jane’s pie somewhere else until she could deal with her. Jasmine turned with a smirk and almost dropped the pink box as she bumped into a tall, black woman.

Jasmine’s smile, and her words, “excuse me…” fell onto the hard linoleum as her eyes caught the burning coals of anger in the woman’s face. 

“What are you doing with my pie?” The woman huffed, holding onto the pink box, her snarl showing a glimpse of sharp white teeth. 

Jasmine had dropped the box, she realized but this woman had caught it.

“I’m just moving it,” Jasmine stammered, “to make more room for the other-”

“Get your hands off my pie!”

“I’m sorry, I thought this was my cousin Jane’s pie.” Her hands flew back. “ My name is Jasmine, and-”

The woman’s face softened. “I know who you are. My name is Myesha.” She elbowed Jasmine out of the way to reposition the pie back on the table. “Good luck in the contest.” Myesha winked.

        While the judges tallied the scores, Jasmine snuck over to examine this, other strawberry rhubarb pie, a few slices still left on the plate.

“Not exactly the same.” Jasmine murmured to herself. Her Grandma’s pies had the fluted crust edges the judges preferred, her pie would have been scored higher on appearance.

The pie smelled good though, and the buttery crust had the perfect thickness and texture, holding firm, while the filling spilled out, a bright red on the white plate.  

Jasmine couldn’t help herself, she cut a bite off with a fork and put it in her mouth. 

Whoosh! The church hall disappeared. The taste of the pie transported her through time and space until suddenly she sat at her Grandma’s kitchen, eating a slice of pie at the table with the pink patterned enamel top. The sweet-tart flavor made her feel the cracks in the cushion on that chair, the warmth of the brightly lit kitchen, and the comfortableness of just sitting with her Grandma. She looked up into her eyes, twinkling behind her glasses. Grandma’s soft, warm hand covered her own.

 “How do you like it?” She asked, in Myesha’s voice.

Jasmine wanted to stay right there, to be with her Grandma again, and that blessed carefree time when life tasted so sweet.

“Well?” Myesha said.

Jasmine blinked and her Grandma faded into Myesha, her eyes concerned and her hand resting protectively on Jasmine’s.

Jasmine snatched her hand back, looking for her Grandma’s kitchen, just on the edge of her vision, but only saw the church banquet room walls.

“That’s it! that’s my Grandma’s pie, it’s almost like I was back in her kitchen, I…”

Jasmine took another bite, hoping to transport herself again, but now the forkful was just a really good bite of pie. An award winning bite of pie.

“How did you make my Grandma’s pie?” Jasmine reached for one more bite. She shouldn’t eat the whole piece of pie, she was going to be tasting others today, and knew this pie would go straight to her hips, straight to them like she placed a slice on each side of her, but she couldn't stop, each bite made her feel good, feel like she was with her Grandma again, in that little kitchen. That kitchen that didn't exist anymore, had not existed for five years, but goddamn the pie was good. Jasmine’s eyes pricked with tears as her mind toured the past, lost in memories until Myesha’s words finally broke through.

","

“…. she couldn’t cook! Burnt soup that woman did….” Myesha’s arms were crossed on her ample chest.

“What did you say?” Jasmine asked confused, “Who couldn't cook?”

“Your Grandma.” Myesha’s words thudded like stones on the floor between them.

“-My- Grandma, could not cook?” Jasmine licked the crumbs off the fork. “What are you talking about? Whenever I went to her house after school, there were cookies, or brownies, or pies- “ Jasmine pointed with her fork at the crumbs on her plate. A particularly large crumb of crust with a dollop of filling on it caught her eye and she squished it under her fork to pick it up.

“And there was always a casserole, or a roast chicken for Sunday dinners-”

“Did you ever see your Grandma actually cooking?” Myesha asked, her brown eyes wide.

Jasmine’s mouth opened, and while she was thinking she put her fork in her mouth upside-down so she could lick every bit off it.

Images of her Grandma smoking, playing solitaire or filling out the crossword on a folded newspaper came to her mind, but not cooking, never standing anywhere near the stove, nor sink.

“Of course she cooked!” Jasmine shook her head, and finally put her fork down even though she saw one more crumb on the plate.

“How else did all that food get there?”

“My Grandmother worked for your Grandma.” Myesha leaned in. “She cleaned house, and cooked. It’s how it was back then.” 

“But my Grandma entered this pie,” Jasmine pointed at it, “strawberry rhubarb, into the church contest, and won- every year! If your Grandma made the pie, why didn’t she enter it? That doesn’t make sense.” Jasmine folded her arms, her argument flawless.

“Your Grandma might have cooked, and baked. But for this contest, my Grandma wouldn’t have done such a thing.”

Jasmine’s head shook back and forth, trying to get the idea out of her head.

“No way.”

Myesha pursed her lips, tilted her head, folded her own arms.

“Why do you think my Grandma, a black maid, didn’t enter her pie into the -Methodist Church- Baking contest?”

Jasmine’s mouth dropped open, then slapped closed and her arms unfolded.

“But-”Jasmine wanted to deny this idea, to keep her Grandma as the perfect baker, but different memories clicked into place, and she saw the truth.

“Your Grandma gave my Grandma the cash prizes, but kept the ribbons for herself.” Myesha said.

“I’m sorry.” Jasmin said. “I didn’t know.”

“It’s OK. I bake now too, and- ” Myesha said, when the speaker overhead interrupted her.

“-And the winner of this year's Pi Day Baking contest is…”

“I can’t believe neither of us won.” Jasmine said, drinking the thin church coffee. “ Who even likes chocolate cream pie? Damn! I really needed that money.”

“Do you think your cupcake business will work out? I always wanted to start a bakery, but never had the courage to begin. And banker's hours is true, no early mornings."" Myesha frowned into the paper coffee cup. “This is horrible.”

Jasmine looked up. “My cupcakes sell out whenever I have a stand at the weekend market. And it’s what I love. I thought baking was in my blood, but maybe it’s my own thing…”

“What if we went into business together?” Myesha said. “I have some money saved up, and a few recipes from my Grandma, you know they're good. Let’s talk about it over some real coffee.” She tossed her cup in a trash can. “What about the name, ‘Grandma’s Pies and Cakes’?” Myesha offered.

“It's time to honor your Grandma.” Jasmine smiled. ""I love it.""","""Jasmine, I didn't make this pie,"" Myesha said softly, her voice a gentle nudge back to reality. ""Your Grandma did.""

Jasmine's fork clattered to the plate. ""What? That's impossible. She's been dead for five years.""

Myesha nodded, her eyes filled with a knowing sadness. ""I know. But she left something behind. Something more than just recipes.""

Jasmine's heart pounded in her chest. ""What do you mean?""

Myesha took a deep breath. ""Your Grandma and my Grandma were best friends. They shared everything, including their love for baking. When your Grandma passed, she left a part of herself with my Grandma. And when my Grandma passed last year, she left it with me.""

Jasmine's mind raced, trying to piece together the puzzle. ""But how? How could she leave a part of herself?""

Myesha reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, worn locket. She opened it to reveal a tiny, faded photograph of two young women, arms around each other, smiling brightly. ""This locket has been passed down through our families for generations. It's said to hold the spirit of the women who wore it. When your Grandma died, her spirit found its way into this locket.""

Jasmine stared at the locket, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""So, you're saying my Grandma's spirit is in there? And that's how you made the pie?""

Myesha nodded. ""Yes. When I bake, I feel her guiding me, just like she guided you today. That's why the pie tasted like it came from her kitchen. Because, in a way, it did.""

Jasmine felt a tear slip down her cheek. She looked at the pie, then back at Myesha. ""Thank you,"" she whispered. ""Thank you for bringing her back to me, even if just for a moment.""

Myesha smiled, her eyes glistening with tears of her own. ""You're welcome. And good luck in the contest. I think your Grandma would be proud of you.""

As the judges announced the winner, Jasmine didn't care about the prize money or the food truck anymore. She had already won something far more precious: a connection to her Grandma that transcended time and space, brought to life through the magic of a simple, homemade pie.","<brainstorm>
1. Myesha is actually a distant relative of Jasmine's, and the recipe has been passed down through multiple branches of the family.
2. Myesha and Jasmine's Grandma were best friends, and Grandma shared the recipe with her before she passed away.
3. Myesha is a ghost or a supernatural being who has come to ensure the recipe is used properly.
4. Myesha is a time traveler who has come back to ensure Jasmine wins the contest for a greater purpose.
5. Myesha is actually Jasmine's Grandma reincarnated or in disguise, testing Jasmine's dedication and love for baking.

The best idea seems to be that Myesha is a distant relative, which would explain how she has the same recipe and why the pie tastes so familiar. This twist would recontextualize the earlier events and provide a satisfying resolution to the mystery of the pie's origin.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
Jasmine's mind raced as she tried to piece together how Myesha could have made her Grandma's pie. The taste, the texture, everything was too perfect to be a coincidence. She looked up at Myesha, who was watching her with a knowing smile.

""How did you make this pie?"" Jasmine asked again, her voice trembling.

Myesha sighed and pulled out a small, worn notebook from her bag. She handed it to Jasmine, who recognized the familiar cursive immediately. It was the same handwriting as the recipes she had found in her Grandma's kitchen.

""This belonged to my great-grandmother,"" Myesha explained. ""She and your Grandma were sisters. They shared everything, including their recipes. When your Grandma passed away, I inherited this notebook.""

Jasmine's eyes widened in shock. ""So, you're my...?""

""Cousin, yes,"" Myesha confirmed. ""I didn't know about you until recently. When I heard about the Pi Day Pie Baking contest, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to introduce myself and honor our family's legacy.""

Jasmine felt a wave of emotions wash over her—relief, joy, and a deep sense of connection. She had found a piece of her family she never knew existed. The mystery of the pie was solved, and it was more beautiful than she could have imagined.

The judges announced the winners, and Jasmine and Myesha stood side by side, holding hands. When Jasmine's name was called as the first-place winner, she felt a surge of pride and gratitude. She had won the contest, but more importantly, she had gained a new family member and a deeper understanding of her Grandma's legacy.

As they celebrated, Jasmine knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in her life. With Myesha by her side, she was ready to take her baking dreams on the road, honoring the generations of love and baking that had brought them together.

""To family,"" Jasmine toasted, raising a forkful of pie. ""And to the sweetest legacy we could ever have.""

Myesha smiled, clinking her fork against Jasmine's. ""To family,"" she echoed, and they both took a bite, savoring the taste of their shared heritage.

It was over something trivial, but it created a rift that never healed. Your Grandma and mine kept in touch secretly, sharing their love for baking and their cherished recipes. They hoped that one day, their granddaughters would find each other and mend the broken bond.""

Jasmine felt a lump form in her throat. She had always felt a connection to her Grandma's baking, but she never imagined it was part of a larger story, a legacy of friendship and love. ""So, you entered the contest to... what? Reconnect?""

Myesha smiled, a tear slipping down her cheek. ""Yes, and to honor our Grandmas. They would have wanted us to come together, to share our love for baking and to heal the wounds of the past.""

Jasmine's eyes filled with tears as she reached out and took Myesha's hand. ""I'm sorry for what I did. I was so focused on winning, I forgot what really mattered.""

Myesha squeezed her hand gently. ""It's okay. We both have a piece of our Grandmas in us, and that's what truly matters.""

As the judges announced the winners, Jasmine and Myesha stood side by side, their hearts lighter and their bond stronger. Jasmine didn't win the contest, but she gained something far more valuable—a connection to her past and a new friend who shared her love for baking.

The two women left the church auditorium together, their laughter mingling with the crisp spring air. They knew that their Grandmas were smiling down on them, proud of the legacy they had passed on and the new chapter they had begun."," The church hall seemed to shrink and swell around Jasmine as she stared down at the pink cardboard box that still held Jane's imposter pie. In a split second of desperation-fueled genius, she slid her hand towards the nearest table, snatching up an empty glass pitcher from one of the refreshments stands. With deft fingers and a quick swipe with her pocket knife, Jasmine emptied the contents into her palm, revealing a shimmering layer of something metallic. It was Grandma's old locket – the antique silver piece she’d shown her on their last summer together, hidden in plain sight within this stranger's box all along!

As Jasmine clasped it tightly underneath her sweat-beaded palm, a plan unfurled. She slipped out of line and towards the refreshment stand again, grabbing two identical pitchers to fill them with water. The first bite she'd taken was still lingering on her tongue, sweet strawberry rhubarb filling bursting in her mouth like an echo from the past.

As Jasmine returned to Jane’s pie, Myesha’s glare never left her side of Myesha, who had moved back into full protective mode over her Grandma's cherished recipe. 

""I see you have a fondness for my pie."" The woman said, still holding the locket in her hand but with less intensity in her voice. Her eyes squinted as she scrutinized Jasmine. ""Perhaps we can settle this peacefully?""

Jasmine nodded, clutching the pitcher like a lifeline to herself and the memories of Grandma's kitchen. ""Yes,"" she swallowed hard on her breadth for courage before explaining, ""I just... I thought it was my cousin Jane’s."" 

Myesha softened, almost imperceptibly. With that, Jasmine placed a pitcher back in its place and took the box from Myesha. She set down the empty one, replaced by an eerie silence only broken by the shuffling of papers as scores were tallied nearby. 

Myesha watched, her eyes not so much suspicious but understanding now. Jasmine's stomach churned with a mix of guilt and anticipation. She knew she shouldn’t taste Jane’s pie, it was against the rules to do so before judging, but the temptation was too strong.

As the last slice melted on her tongue, Jasmine closed her eyes and wished herself back into Grandma's kitchen. It felt warmly real—the smell of baking bread, the soft humming of an old radio, the comforting feel of that familiar pink cushion-top table underneath her hands—her heart ached with a longing to return to those sweet-tart flavors of yesterday.

Myesha watched as Jasmine's eyes glistened with unshed tears; it wasn’t the pie that brought them forth, but memories soaked in bittersweetness and warmth. With an understanding smile, she nodded towards Jane who was now looking at her confusedly from across the room.

“That's enough!” Myesha said suddenly, breaking Jasmine out of her reverie. “We can all still taste a slice or two.” Her voice held both amusement and respect as she gestured to other contestants joining them for tasting their pies. 

Jane’s pie had been repositioned on the table but Jasmine, with an even wider smile now, took another bite from Jane's slice of her Grandma's pie and offered a plate up to Myesha. The church hall was back in focus as she returned it, along with the pitcher filled once more.

A silent understanding passed between them—a truce sealed by strawberry rhubarb pie.","z p f h"
"26",26," Curtis and The Critical Cog ",26,609,"6/20/2024","He turns the creature almost imperceptibly, with the slightest tremor. His fingers steady as he brings the knife to its throat. He now is intently focused, and fails to register as the first, second, third droplets splatter into the folds of his trousers.

Gradually, it becomes. It ain’t about speed, Pop pounded home time after time. Careful strokes, the pare, the push, the pull; let the grain, the knots, the imperfections guide you.

Mr. Bronheim?

It’s one of THEM, the one who brought him the dry chicken, the yellow gravy, the peas, the pills. The big one. Behind him, an Indian got up like a doctor. Dot-not-feather, He chuckles. The big one just stares as he takes a step into the room.

The other colored guy places a hand on his arm, gently pulls him out of the doorway. There’s a gun on his belt, like Pop’s keepers at Joliet. His gnarled fingers tighten on the knife.

Mr. Bronheim. This time, it’s the Swami. What have you made there? He’s dropped it on the spread, and now displays it, thumb and forefinger.

Amazing work. Did you do the feathers yourself? May I see, please? Where did you learn such a thing?

It’s about supper. Big Jim now. You want me to put your tools away so you can wash up?

He smiles, flips the jackknife the way Pop taught him, safety first. Am I going home?

The smile vanishes as the second colored fellow again restrains the bigger man and steps in. Nice knife, right? ‘RB’?

My Pop. Warily, but He allows this one to examine the Case Redbone. That’s when he spots the blood, on the spread, on his trousers, on the fake wood next to his bed. He inspects his calloused hands for cuts – Pop would have whupped him good for such carelessness. Despite blood turning to rust in his whorls and creases, He’s uninjured. Relief floods his face as the colored man carefully tucks the knife into a plastic bag with gloved hands. Then anger flushes his features.

That’s mine, He says, voice trembling now, adding a single word meant to draw the thief up, to let him know who was running things around here.

The man only glances up with a smile. Luckily, a policeman, white, enters the room, and He wobbles up to get the blood off his hands and some food in his belly. Chicken today, He seems to recall.

“I thought it’d be like therapy,” Jeff Bronheim mumbled, trying to shrink into his broken green recliner. “Whittling always seemed to, uh, to calm him down, and maybe it might help his memory, though it’s pretty much moths flappin’ around up there these days. I just didn’t see any harm…”

“In giving a man who can barely remember his own name a knife in an Alzheimer’s center,” Curtis said.

The banty little redneck had that expression Det. Mead had seen a thousand times before, as grand marshal of Millington’s glorious and endless Parade of Felons, Fumblers, and Fuckups. Stunned surprise that inevitable consequences had landed on schedule; vague guilt tempered by calculation, bloodshot eyes darting about looking for a legal, a moral escape hatch.

“Your dad stabbed the man in the next room, went back to his own room and carved a bird out of a block of wood the same genius who supplied the jackknife probably gave him.”

“It was Granddad’s.”

“Ah, backstory,” Detective Mead nodded. “So your dad, he’ll probably get sent to the Packard Center in Springfield. You, now – if bone stupid’s not a mitigating factor, you could be facing negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter.”

Bronheim the Younger looked to his sweating Code Red Dew for illumination. “So, who’d Dad kill?”

“Nice you should ask.”

**

“Have you ever read Elizabeth Kubler-Ross?”

“Five stages of death lady,” Curtis supplied, courtesy of Final Jeopardy. “Denial, anger, depression, acceptance, and I missed one, didn’t I?”

“Bargaining. Usually happens between anger and depression – you try to barter with God, fate, the universe for another year, another month, another week.” Dr. Saraj Patel eased back in his office chair. “You get the same stages with dementia patients. But in the case of our residents, it often manifests in more complex ways. Many hopscotch through the stages out of sequence as memory flickers in and out. Mr. Bronheim transitions on an irregular cycle between cheerful denial, unresponsive funk, and colorfully racist rage.”

Curtis smirked. “And Mr. Sheppard?”

“Mr. Sheppard was actually a quite pleasant man –he was in his own way philosophical about his situation, what he could understand of it. He told me more than once we were but small cogs in the universe, that our fates were not our own. I believe he was at a stage of acceptance.”

“On less metaphysical grounds,” Curtis murmured, “where were your folks when the existential Mr. Sheppard was getting murdered?”

Patel sighed deeply. “It doesn’t happen often, but we’re guessing a visiting family member must have accidentally supplied a resident the front-door keypad code, and we were forced to call a Code Gray – an emergency patient count and an all-hands search for Mrs. Dalby. Marcus personally looked in on both Mr. Bronheim, who was napping, and Mr. Sheppard, who was absorbed in a Cubs game. All I can suspect is that in the ensuing, well, chaos, Mr. Bronheim for whatever imaginable reason stabbed his neighbor. We’re now reassessing emergency protocols.”

“Prudent.”

**

“Shit, I lost it with every old racist in this place, I’d wind up, well, here,” Marcus Compton barked, peering in the breakroom microwave. Satisfied the burrito was on a trajectory toward success, he turned back to Curtis. “Now, Wilton – Mr. Sheppard – he’d get flustered when he’d get ‘lost,’ you know? But he was friendly, didn’t order me around like it was 1825, didn’t bitch about the food – fact, said he liked it, which to each his own, you feel me? Patel would freak out if he heard a nurse tell you this, but I really do think he was getting better. He’d start talking ‘bout the Cubs, remembering things from his childhood, I guess. Said he didn’t eat too well, didn’t get enough veggies and shit. Which is sorta weird, because he was like kinda rich, right?”

Curtis frowned as he sipped his inadvertent cold brew. Keurig hadn’t reached this rung of the health care system. “Sheppard Appliances. Daughter runs things now.”

“Yeah, ain’t seen her so much lately,” Marcus said neutrally. “The husband seems more like blood – even watches a game with the old man once in a while.”

“Mm. What’s your take on Bronheim? You ever see the two of them go at it?”

“Nah, maybe they argued in the dining room one time, probably over the Cubs. You saw what the old guy carved – cardinal. Probably a St. Louis fan at some point. They talked sometimes, but then Wilton had his fall, and after he got back from the hospital, he kinda stayed to himself.”

“Hospital? When was this?”

“Oh, maybe three weeks ago. Didn’t break anything, but he coded at the St. Mark’s ER. Caused some kind of ruckus there, I guess. Trauma and hospital craziness adds a whole other level for these folks.”

“And you said Bronheim was sleeping and Sheppard was watching the Cubs when they called the code on the Dalby woman? Sheppard say anything?”

“Back was to me – into the game, or just dozed off.”

Curtis perked. “Any idea who gave Mrs. Dalby the passcode out?”

The nurse shrugged. “Ever heard the expression, herding cats?”

**

“I’d call it a deathbed declaration, even though it turned out premature.” Dr. Grolson was cordial — only one of the ER stalls was occupied. She nonetheless continued to peek toward the LED clock over the nurse station.

“Mr. Sheppard was aggravated when they brought him in, but calmed down pretty quick when we explained he only had a sprain, and one of the other patients had an episode while we were waiting for family. When the LPN came back, she found him circling his chart.”

Curtis nodded at an old woman with a purple blossom over half her face. A grimace emerged through the bruises. “What did he circle?”

“The whole thing — the whole form, and when Terese, the nurse, tried to take it away, they got in a tug-of-war. Then, a few minutes later, he suffered a cardiac episode, and while we were trying to get the cart in place, he started yelling. Same things over and over -- ‘table,’ ‘leader,’ and, oh yeah, ‘eagle.’ Delirium, I’m guessing. A distressed brain in aggravated distress..”

“But his recovery went all right?”

“Shipped him back to Sunrise Center after four days of bedrest and monitoring.” The physician winced. “Didn’t mean that to sound so insensitive. About to go off a double shift, and I guess my brain’s a little distressed, too.”

Curtis felt her.

**

The truck was stationed on the fringe of the Kohl’s lot today, and social media and a recent network reality show had attracted a swarm. Curtis as always got table service, and as A Little Bite of Soul’s lunch line winnowed out, his nephew dropped a second order of burnt ends on the aluminum table and his butt on the bench opposite.

“You think?” Anton inquired, wiping a spec of sweet and spicy off his glasses.

Unable to articulate for the moment, Curtis nodded vigorously. The cop swallowed, and jerked his chin toward the freestanding whiteboard menu. “Little pricey for scraps, maybe.”

“Lowball the customer, they feel like they’re getting scraps. We’re As Seen On TV now. Which speaking, saw you on 25 last night, at that nursing home on West. Some grizzly shit, huh.”

“Memory care center,” Curtis said, pulling the fresh brisket cuttings closer. “Yeah, got some problems there. Chris – our tech, you met her Labor Day? She says from the angle of the knife thrust that killed Mr. Sheppard, the blow was from behind. Over his shoulder and backward thrust straight in between the ribs while he was watching the Cubbies. Remember how tall Sheppard was on those old commercials?”

“‘At Sheppard’s Appliances, we never forget a customer!’” Anton declared.

“Yeah, irony wasn’t lost. So, did you see Bronheim, the suspect?”

“Looked like one of those Keebler elves – ooooohh…”

“Yup. Lemme give you a word association test. What do ‘eagle,’ ‘leader,’ and ‘table’ mean to you?”

Anton took a sip of his Coke, squinted toward the one remaining mall anchor across the lot, and snapped his fingers. “Eagle Leader. It’s a game – you remember Cousin Marcus, was in the Navy? He plays that shit. Like, NATO against the Russians or something.”

“Didn’t strike me as a gamer.”

“One of those games you play with yourself. All kinds of cards and strategy maps and modules and stuff. A table game,” Anton said significantly. “Your little homicidal elf strike you as a gamer?”

“Marbles, back in the Depression, maybe,” Curtis suggested. “Hey, you call your grandma lately? She asked last week.”

“Took her some lunch at the nursing home Sunday. Where you think I got the idea for the whiteboard? Though theirs was three days off.”   

**

“Yeah, sure,” the doctor conceded, a little too briskly, a little too loudly, with more than a hint of exasperation. Curtis smiled patiently. “There are other potential physical causes, though dementia isn’t uncommon in a man of Wilton Sheppard’s advanced age. An abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, nutritional deficiencies, exposure to toxic lead levels, Huntington’s Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob...”

“Mad Cow?”

Curtis could swear he heard the pharma pen crack slightly in Patrick Logue’s plump pink fingers. “Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is also a prion disorder, but a separate condition. We’ve also seen a few cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but mainly in cases of more extreme elder abuse. Mr. Sheppard’s daughter and her husband have been dedicated caretakers. Terry – the son-in-law – accompanied Wilton to his appointments and took meticulous notes, which I have to say is unusual for a non-blood relation, and Jana and I have gone through every detail, from exercise and diet to routine self-maintenance. There were positively no signs of parental abuse, and it’s not exactly like they live in some… hovel…with lead paint or old pipes.”

“You check that other stuff? The Huntington’s and the brain fluid, any of that?”

Logue took a heavy, meaty breath. “You’ve certainly heard of HIPAA. Patient confidentiality doesn’t end with the patient’s death, you know. You can get a court order if you want…”

“Or we can just talk in theoreticals or whatever language makes you most comfortable and helps me figure out what happened to your patient. Under ordinary circumstances, with a man of Mr. Sheppard’s advanced age and, uh, situation, you run all the traps? I can go right ahead and get that court order, you wan—“

“Look,” the physician finally appealed, quietly. “I ran a standard cognitive test that pointed to more rapid memory deterioration, and I proceeded from there. There were no indicators for Creutzfeldt-Jakob or history of Huntington’s. Detective?”

Curtis blinked. “Sorry. Wonder maybe you could walk me through that memory test you gave Mr. Sheppard? My mom’s getting on, and I’m curious.”

Dr. Logue seemed relieved by the transition, and drew a sheet of blank paper and a pen from his desk. “Gladly. So first, I’m going to give you three words to remember...”

**

“It was all that talk about how we’re all just little cogs in the universe, in the scheme of things,” Curtis said. “I got to wondering what put that bug in the old man’s head. You ever hear of the Mini-Cog?”

A veiled spark only a seasoned cop might detect, though Det. Mead conceded nobody here was taking home an Oscar or even a Tony unless they broke into some Andrew Lloyd Webber real fast. “Not familiar. Only medical stuff I know is what I see on Good Doctor or Chicago Med.”

“Quickie Alzheimer’s test, mainly for short-term recall and how your brain’s processing, uh, stuff,” Curtis smiled. “Doctor named Soo Borson – S-O-O – came up with it. You ask the patient to remember three words, then have ’em draw a clock set to a specific time. When the patient gets done with their little art project, you ask them to recall their magic words.”

“Like I said, not familiar.”

","

“Yeah, I know. Here’s the thing, though. How’d you know the Mini-Cog was ‘medical stuff?’ Sounds more like something you’d go to the Ace for when the sump pump’s on the fritz. And you ought to know, because you sat in on your father-in-law’s Mini-Cog test with Dr. Logue. Shit, your wife asked the doc to do a dementia test during his exam. Dr. Logue said you were very attentive during the whole thing, thought you ought to get some kind of trophy for best son-in-law.”

“Well, he’s family,” Terry Erlach grinned. Self-deprecatingly. “Jana would do it for my mom or dad…”

“Seriously?”

“What?”

“You don’t recall the test that basically put Mr. Sheppard on the road to the Alzheimer’s ward?” Curtis inquired. “You kind of suck at this, you know?”

“Suck at what?”

“You didn’t recognize your father-in-law’s dying declaration? Well, almost dying declaration? Dr. Logue doesn’t like fucking with HIPAA, but when I played his little memory game with him, I think he saw where I was going. That circle your father-in-law drew on his ER chart? Gonna bet you that was a clock, and he infarcted or whatever before he could draw the hands and 10 and 5. Dr. Logue doesn’t like to tax his own memory, so he sticks to the same time – 10:25 – and the same three key words – eagle, table, leader. It was the most important thing to Mr. Sheppard at that point. He’d remembered.

“Now, why in the world was that important when for all the man knows, he’s about to shuffle off this mortal coil? A point of pride? The last word? Or maybe your father-in-law knew he’d been bamboozled, that you and Mrs. Erlach had hustled him into the Center on false pretenses. Now, I don’t know much beyond what I see on Chicago Med, either, but I can Google like nobody’s business. Exposure to lead levels, dietary deficiencies like a severe shortage of folate, Vitamin B9, from leafy greens and grains – lotta things can look like dementia or Alzheimer’s, and if you want to get an old man out of the way, lotta ways to fake a diagnosis.

“Personally, I’m betting on the folate thing – Dr. Logue said once you theoretically take Alzheimer’s off the table, Mr. Sheppard showed several symptoms that might be due to a deficiency. He seemed depressed and weak, talked about headaches, had a couple mouth sores, and Logue even spotted some warning signs for colon or pancreatic cancer. And his irritability, the anger – that’s another symptom you’re not getting your daily folate. Dr. Logue confirmed your father-in-law’d never had Crohn’s disease or celiac or anything like that can fu--, ah, impede your folate absorption. Prolly easy enough to tinker with his diet – when what’s good for you, well, tastes ‘good for you,’ you tend to not ask questions.”

“Why would I – we – why would his own daughter do something like that?”

“Damn. You about dislocated yourself there. And, again, seriously? Thing is, when the ER doctor told you what Dad’d done, what he’d said, you knew whatever you two’d done to him was wearing off. That somebody just might listen to what he had to say if he showed a miracle recovery. But what were you going to do in a hospital? You had to take your chances and wait ‘til they moved him back to the memory center to shut him up. Sunrise Center was understaffed, you’d seen Bronheim whittling his little birdies, so you created some chaos of your own and—”

“It was all Jana’s—”

“There it is,” Curtis proclaimed. “Hold that thought.”","Curtis leaned back, his eyes narrowing as he studied the doctor. ""You know, I’ve been thinking about that clock. It’s a simple test, but it tells you a lot. And it got me wondering about Mr. Sheppard’s clock.""

Dr. Logue’s face remained impassive, but a slight twitch in his left eye betrayed him. ""What about it?""

""Well, I had a look at it. The hands were set to 3:15, but the numbers were all jumbled. Almost like someone who knew what a clock should look like but couldn’t quite get it right. And then I remembered something else.""

Curtis pulled out a small notebook and flipped through it. ""When Mr. Sheppard was in the ER, he kept saying ‘table,’ ‘leader,’ and ‘eagle.’ At first, I thought it was just delirium. But then I realized he was trying to tell us something.""

Dr. Logue’s face paled slightly. ""Detective, I don’t see where you’re going with this.""

Curtis smiled, a predator’s smile. ""You see, ‘table’ and ‘leader’ didn’t make sense until I thought about the clock. The numbers were jumbled because Mr. Sheppard’s brain was jumbled. But ‘eagle’—well, that’s a different story. It’s not just a bird. It’s a symbol. And it’s also a name.""

Dr. Logue’s eyes widened. ""What are you implying?""

""I’m implying that Mr. Sheppard wasn’t just a dementia patient. He was a man who knew too much. About you, Dr. Logue. Or should I say, Dr. Eagle?""

The room fell silent. Dr. Logue’s face twisted into a snarl. ""You have no proof.""

Curtis leaned forward, his voice low and menacing. ""I have enough. You see, Mr. Sheppard’s daughter mentioned something interesting. Her father had been working on a memoir, something about his time in the military. He was a codebreaker during the Cold War. And he had a knack for remembering faces and names, even as his mind started to slip.""

Dr. Logue’s face turned ashen. ""This is absurd.""

""Is it? Or is it more likely that you, a man with a new identity, a man who thought he’d escaped his past, found yourself face-to-face with someone who could expose you? Mr. Sheppard recognized you, didn’t he? And you couldn’t risk him blowing your cover. So you waited for the right moment, during the chaos of the Code Gray, and you silenced him.""

Dr. Logue lunged for the door, but Curtis was faster. He grabbed the doctor’s arm and twisted it behind his back, forcing him to the ground. ""You’re under arrest for the murder of Wilton Sheppard.""

As Curtis cuffed the doctor, he couldn’t help but think of the irony. A man who had spent his life hiding in plain sight, brought down by the very thing he thought he’d escaped. The past always has a way of catching up, Curtis mused. And sometimes, it comes with a knife.","<brainstorm>
1. **The Son-in-Law's Motive**: Terry, the son-in-law, has been poisoning Mr. Sheppard to accelerate his dementia and gain control of the family business. The fall and subsequent hospital visit were part of his plan to make Mr. Sheppard's condition appear worse. The ""eagle,"" ""leader,"" and ""table"" were clues Mr. Sheppard tried to leave behind, referring to the Eagle Leader game Terry played, which involved a table where he kept his poisons.

2. **The Nurse's Involvement**: Marcus, the nurse, is in on the scheme with Terry. He provided the knife to Mr. Bronheim, knowing his dementia would make him a perfect scapegoat. Marcus's neutral comments about Terry and Jana were meant to deflect suspicion.

3. **The Code Gray Distraction**: The Code Gray was a deliberate distraction orchestrated by Terry and Marcus to create chaos, allowing Terry to slip into Mr. Sheppard's room and administer a final dose of poison. Mr. Bronheim's knife was then used to stage the murder.

4. **The Clock Drawing**: The clock drawing test was manipulated by Terry. He had been coaching Mr. Sheppard to fail the test, reinforcing the appearance of severe dementia. The words ""eagle,"" ""leader,"" and ""table"" were part of the test, and Mr. Sheppard's attempt to circle his chart was a desperate effort to communicate the truth.

5. **The Final Confrontation**: Curtis pieces together the clues and confronts Terry and Marcus. He uses the Mini-Cog test results and the inconsistencies in their stories to expose their plot. The twist reveals that Mr. Sheppard was more aware than anyone realized and had been trying to leave clues about his predicament.

Curtis leaned back, the pieces finally clicking into place. ""You know, Dr. Logue, I think I will take that court order. But first, let's talk about those three words Mr. Sheppard was supposed to remember.""

Logue's eyes narrowed. ""Eagle, leader, table. Why?""

Curtis smiled. ""Because they weren't random. Mr. Sheppard was trying to tell us something. 'Eagle' refers to the Eagle Leader game Terry plays. 'Leader' points to Terry himself, the one orchestrating this whole mess. And 'table' is where Terry kept his poisons.""

Curtis's eyes hardened. ""Now, we bring them in. And we make sure Mr. Sheppard's final attempt to seek justice isn't in vain.""

As Curtis walked out, he felt a sense of closure. The pieces had fallen into place, and the truth was finally revealed. Mr. Sheppard's cryptic words had led him to the real culprits, and justice would be served. The twisted plot had been unraveled, and the memory care center would no longer be a place of hidden darkness.

Curtis pulled out a small notepad from his jacket pocket, flipping it open to a page filled with scribbles. ""I had a chat with one of the nurses who was there during Sheppard's test. She remembered the words: 'eagle,' 'leader,' and 'table.'""

Mead's eyes widened. ""The same words Sheppard was shouting in the ER?""

Curtis nodded. ""Exactly. And it got me thinking. Why those words? They seemed random at first, but then I remembered what Anton said about that game, Eagle Leader. It's a solo strategy game, right? But what if it wasn't just a game to Sheppard?""

Mead leaned forward, intrigued. ""Go on.""

Curtis continued, ""Sheppard's mind was deteriorating, but he was still sharp in some ways. What if he was trying to tell us something? What if those words were a clue, a message he was trying to leave behind?""

Mead frowned. ""But how does that connect to his murder?""

Curtis took a deep breath. ""I did some digging into Sheppard's past. Turns out, before he retired and handed the business over to his daughter, he was involved in some pretty shady deals. Money laundering, tax evasion, you name it. He was never caught, but he had enemies. People who might want him dead.""

Mead's eyes narrowed. ""And you think one of those enemies got to him in the nursing home?""

Curtis shook his head. ""No, I think it was closer to home. Remember how Marcus said Sheppard's son-in-law, Terry, was always around, taking meticulous notes? What if Terry found out about Sheppard's past and decided to take matters into his own hands?""

Mead's jaw tightened. ""You think Terry killed Sheppard?""

Curtis nodded. ""I think Terry saw an opportunity when the code gray was called. He knew Sheppard would be alone, watching the Cubs. He slipped into the room, stabbed him from behind, and made it look like Bronheim did it. Bronheim, with his dementia, wouldn't remember a thing.""

Mead stood up, pacing the room. ""But why? What would Terry gain from killing Sheppard?""

Curtis closed his notepad, slipping it back into his pocket. ""Money, power, control over the family business. Maybe even revenge for something Sheppard did in the past. We need to bring Terry in for questioning.""

Mead nodded, determination in his eyes. ""Let's do it.""

As they left the room, Curtis couldn't shake the feeling that they were on the brink of uncovering something much bigger. The pieces were finally falling into place, and soon, the truth would be revealed.

**

Terry Sheppard sat in the interrogation room, his face pale and sweaty. Curtis and Mead stood on either side of him, their expressions stern.

""Terry, we know about your father-in-law's past,"" Curtis began. ""We know about the shady deals, the enemies he made. And we know you were the one who killed him.""

Terry's eyes widened in shock. ""What? No, I didn't—""

Curtis cut him off. ""Save it. We have evidence. Witnesses who saw you enter Sheppard's room during the code gray. Your fingerprints on the knife. And we know about the words he was shouting in the ER. 'Eagle,' 'leader,' 'table.' He was trying to tell us something, and we figured it out.""

Terry's shoulders slumped, defeat washing over him. ""I didn't have a choice,"" he whispered. ""He was going to ruin everything. The business, our family. I had to stop him.""

Curtis and Mead exchanged a glance. The case was closed, but the fallout was just beginning. As they led Terry away, Curtis couldn't help but think about the words Sheppard had left behind. In the end, it was the old man's mind, deteriorating but still sharp, that had led them to the truth."," As they were leaving the hospital that day, Curtis thought about his next appointment with Mrs. Sheehan and her son's daughter. ""You know it's a bit different,"" she tells herself to have your client’s family history in 1927.""

“Sometimes we take some time for you are saying good?

Q&A: The End

“It was always amusing how you're not going to let that? Only when he started out, there are a few things I don’t understand why it was so. ""I remember the story of his next appointment with Mrs. Sheehan, your childhood sweetheart, and as they sat on the edge of their nursing home in Duluth, Minnesota:

“Hey, Doctor, but you've certainly done something truly extraordinary for us,” he said a little girl from the 1920s: ""Doctor named Soo Borson – S-O-O” and her daughter. “Nah, well, I guess it’s probably my last name is what I see on Good Doctor or Seattle Med.”

“Yes. That's right, you know,” she continued with your next appointment with Mrs. Shepard’s mother and the nursing home was also a man of William Bancroft, but mainly in cases of acute hepatobronchial arthritis that only 32% of his patients are actually going to see you for blood test or old pipes. Only one of my son's getting on with their mother at the nursing home, and a man named George Sheppard:

“You know it was all set up in Chicago, mainly because he’d like that! 

“Yes.”

The Enderby Bay is a thrilling mystery novel. It has been discovered that we should have taken the case of an alien invasion as part of our story, but with only four different countries represented on the shelves of India's nursing home in New York City for treatment by Dr. Mead concluded:

A group of students are they not just a few days off and you might also be familiar to those who have been taking care of it all—a 24-year-old art project, the patient has shown signs of physical injury caused by exposure to toxic lead levels or Huntington's Disease.

Thievery

Someone has been stealing from our local Piggly Wiggly for the last two months. Although the store has upped their security since finding out about the missing items, no culprits arrested. Most of the items taken were sodas, rolling papers, lighters, chips, and cigarettes. If I didn't know any better I'd say it was the work of one or many of the youth here in our community. Taking their ill gotten gains for a little fun in the woods among friends. Are your children doing drugs in the woods? Do you know where your teenagers are and what they're doing?

Cold Case

We've learned a secret about a decades old murder case that happened right here in Boulder City in 1991. After being reported missing for several weeks, Megan Grace (19), was found floating face down in the Shady Bottom Creek on the 25th of May. A local fisherman found the body when he snagged his line on a nearby tree in the riverbed and drifted his boat to the tangle of tree roots and muck to untangle it. Although Megan's body was found in the creek, the coroner didn't find evidence of water in her lungs. Due to the fact that she was in the water for quite some time before she was found, a cause of death has never been determined. Our source says someone in our community murdered Megan and that she was strangled to death in the rough stretch of woods known in Boulder City as the Bend. Once she was dead, her body was placed in the bed of a dark colored pick up and it headed off in the direction of Shady Bottom Creek. Our source tells us that they were in the woods that night but they never came forward because they feared the consequences of getting involved with certain people in our community.

Justice?

Two teens were arrested on Tuesday night for shoplifting at the local Piggy Wiggly. But were they the thieves implicated in our earlier entry a few days ago? Our local source tells us they believe the teens have two other accomplices and the kids were working in different spots inside the store so they could obtain multiple items at once without taking all the risk upon themselves. So far there hasn't been a mention of any more names from the teens in question.

Prostitution, Drugs and Arrests

“Pastor Jim” Higgins of First Baptist Church in our very own Boulder City was arrested yesterday afternoon for Embezzlement, Misappropriation of funds and Possession. Money raised in April at First Baptist for projects such as a new roof, upgrading the air conditioning system and landscaping were instead used to pay for Mr.Higgins’ terrible addictions to cocaine and sex workers. Authorities confirmed as much when a sting on prostitution in the area caught Mr.Higgins in a motel room with 3 prostitutes, a kilo of cocaine and a suitcase full of the church's money. Sounds like Mr.Higgins should have been serving the Lord instead of serving himself. Sheriff Thomas tells us that the funds located at the motel will be returned to First Baptist once the paperwork has cleared. Our local minister Sherry Miller will be accepting applications for a new pastor while overtaking the role. You can pick up the application at the church and put it in the mail slot on your way out.

Vandalism, Mistaken Identity or Revenge?

Authorities were called to the Boulder City Steel plant early this morning after reports of a vandalized vehicle came in. Someone busted out all of Mitchell Wade's windows including the windshield in his green Chevy Silverado pickup. The plant manager tells us that there are no cameras in the area used for parking, just on the property where materials are stored and within the plant itself. Authorities are asking if you have any information on who might have targeted Mr.Wade to come forward. Could Mr.Wade be the infamous green pickup in our earlier story warranting the revenge of a spurned lover? Or could this simply be a case of mistaken identity? Could this be the work of some local kids or a spiteful coworker? Only time will tell. Or maybe our avid readers are holding onto a few more secrets.

Connection to Megan Grace Cold Case?

An anonymous contributor has confided in us here at the BCG that the death of Alvin Green is connected to the decades old cold case of Megan Grace. Our source insists that Mr.Greens death was a direct result of his involvement in the case as the “Witness in the Woods”. The contributor tells us that Alvin gave them more information on what he saw that night including the fact that the dark colored pick up truck had a busted tail light and a dent in the passenger side door. They tell us that Alvin told them who the killer is! Our source believes that Alvin was killed to keep him quiet about the killer's identity. Authorities have confirmed that upon exhumation and evaluation by a forensic anthropologist, the cause of death in the Megan Grace case is strangulation. Evidence of a fractured hyoid bone confirms the findings. The sheriffs office is reopening Megan's case. We recommend to the community to stay vigilant and if you see something, or know something, say something. If you have any information on who might have committed this murder or the murder of Megan Grace please call the local sheriff's office at 304-218-9300.

Red, White and Blue Skin

You soon may find that you know the identity of the couple that let “Dave” the pig out of the barn. Sources have been writing in to tell us all about how the couple were found out. Suspicious and determined to find out the truth, one group of teens decided to stake out one of their big sisters' boyfriends and it led to the discovery of the suspected affair. Instead of telling her sister what she knew she decided to get revenge for her instead. The group waited near the old dilapidated shack that used to belong to the Jones’ out on Route 3 and made a plan. Just when things were getting hot and heavy between the couple, our teens dropped 4 buckets of blue food coloring right over them from the rafters. Stained blue skin is sure to stick out like a sore thumb! We here at the BCG feel that justice was served considering the laughs they will no doubt receive at the sight of their blue hues. This is sure to be a 4th of July they won't soon forget! The Independence Day Parade and Festival starts tomorrow morning at 9 am with lots of fun activities taking place throughout the day and night.

Special Edition Report

In the early morning hours of July 14th the body of Jessy May Wade (48) was found beaten and strangled to death in the woods off of Route 3. She hadn't been seen since she was spotted crying, walking down Route 3, the day her husband's truck was vandalized. Her sister, Amy Shepherd, filed the missing person's report that led to her discovery on July 1st, after receiving concerning text messages and then being unable to get ahold of Jessy for days. Investigators at a mid-morning press conference on August 1st, announced that Jessy had sent several text messages to her sister implicating her husband, 52 year old Mitchell Wade in the murders of Megan Grace and Alvin Green. Confirming reports from Greens granddaughter that Alvin was ""The Watcher In The Woods and Wade was the killer, authorities have tied Wade to both crimes. The Boulder City Sheriff's Office is also convinced that the murders of Jessy May and Janice Clay are also the work of Mr.Wade in an attempt to keep his crimes a secret. Alvin Green knew who the killer was, he saw him! His wife Jessy, found out about it and became a liability. Janice, reported on it and caused the old case to be reopened. As for Megans death, unless Wade gives a full confession,we may never know what let to her death. In the months since his detainment, Mr.Wade has refused to comment to reporters about his crimes. Wade’s next court date will be 10/20/23 and he is facing life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murders of Megan Grace, Alvin Green, Jessy May Wade and Janice Clay. All of us here at the BCG and those out in our community are confident that justice will be served for all those we so tragically lost.","Tell me your secrets

The Final Revelation

Dear readers, it is with a heavy heart that I write this final entry. The Boulder City Gazette has decided to permanently close the ""Tell Me Your Secrets"" column. The loss of Janice Clay, our beloved Miss Mystery, has left a void that cannot be filled. However, before we bid you farewell, there is one last secret that must be revealed.

In the weeks following Janice's tragic death, the authorities have been working tirelessly to piece together the puzzle of the murders that have plagued our community. The connection between Megan Grace, Alvin Green, and now Janice Clay was undeniable. All three were strangled, and all three had secrets that someone wanted to keep buried.

An anonymous tip led the police to re-examine the emails sent to the Boulder City Gazette. Among the thousands of messages, one stood out. It was a confession, hidden in plain sight, sent by someone who had been feeding us information all along. The email was traced back to none other than Mitchell Wade.

Mitchell Wade, the man whose green truck was the subject of infidelity rumors, whose wife Jessy May Wade went missing, and whose truck was vandalized, was the killer. The truth is, Mitchell had been living a double life. He was the one having an affair with the bank teller, and when his wife found out, she vandalized his truck in a fit of rage. But that was just the tip of the iceberg.

Mitchell had been involved in Megan Grace's murder all those years ago. Alvin Green, the ""Witness in the Woods,"" had seen Mitchell's truck that night and had been blackmailing him ever since. When Alvin decided to come clean, Mitchell silenced him for good. Janice Clay, our Miss Mystery, had gotten too close to the truth, and Mitchell couldn't risk being exposed.

The police found Jessy May Wade's body buried in a shallow grave near the old Jones' shack on Route 3. She had confronted Mitchell about his affair and his past, and he had killed her to keep her quiet.

Mitchell Wade has been arrested and charged with the murders of Megan Grace, Alvin Green, Janice Clay, and Jessy May Wade. As we close this chapter, we urge you to remember that secrets have a way of coming to light, no matter how deeply they are buried.

Thank you for being a part of our community and for sharing your secrets with us. Stay safe, Boulder City.

Yours truly,
Mr. Mysterious","<brainstorm>
1. **Theodora's True Identity**: Theodora, who initially reported the infidelity, is actually Janice Clay (Miss Mystery). She used the column to expose secrets and manipulate events in the town.
2. **The Green Truck Connection**: The green truck mentioned in the infidelity and vandalism stories is the same truck involved in Megan Grace's murder. Mitchell Wade, the owner, is the killer.
3. **Alvin Green's Secret**: Alvin Green was blackmailing Mitchell Wade with the information he had about Megan Grace's murder, leading to his own death.
4. **Jessy May Wade's Disappearance**: Jessy discovered her husband's involvement in the murders and vandalized his truck out of anger. She went missing because she was trying to gather evidence against him.
5. **Mr. Mysterious' Role**: Mr. Mysterious is actually a detective who was working with Janice Clay to uncover the truth about the murders. He takes over the column to continue their work after her death.
6. **The Final Twist**: The real killer is revealed to be someone unexpected, like a prominent community member who manipulated Mitchell Wade into committing the murders.

Combining these ideas, the ending will reveal that Mitchell Wade was manipulated by a prominent community member into committing the murders. Jessy May Wade, who discovered the truth, was trying to gather evidence but was silenced. Mr. Mysterious, a detective, continues the investigation and exposes the true mastermind behind the crimes.

The Truth Unveiled

As the community of Boulder City mourns the loss of Janice Clay, our beloved Miss Mystery, the truth behind the string of murders and secrets begins to unravel. The investigation, now led by Mr. Mysterious, has uncovered shocking revelations that will forever change our town.

Mitchell Wade, the owner of the infamous green truck, was indeed involved in the murders of Megan Grace and Alvin Green. However, he was not acting alone. A prominent community member, none other than Sheriff Thomas, had been manipulating Mitchell for years. Sheriff Thomas, who was supposed to protect and serve, used his position to cover up his own dark secrets.

Years ago, Sheriff Thomas had an illicit affair with Megan Grace. When she threatened to expose him, he coerced Mitchell Wade, a troubled young man with a criminal past, into silencing her. The sheriff promised Mitchell protection and a clean slate in exchange for his compliance. The dark-colored pickup truck with the busted tail light and dented door was indeed Mitchell's, but the orders came from the sheriff.

Alvin Green, the ""Witness in the Woods,"" had seen the sheriff and Mitchell together that fateful night. He had been blackmailing the sheriff for years, which ultimately led to his death. Jessy May Wade, Mitchell's wife, discovered the truth and vandalized her husband's truck in a fit of rage. She went missing because she was gathering evidence to expose the sheriff but was silenced before she could come forward.

Janice Clay, our Miss Mystery, had been working with Mr. Mysterious, a detective undercover as a columnist, to uncover the truth. Her relentless pursuit of justice cost her life, but her legacy lives on. With the evidence gathered by Jessy and the information from Alvin, Mr. Mysterious was able to expose Sheriff Thomas as the true mastermind behind the murders.

Sheriff Thomas has been arrested, and Mitchell Wade, now a broken man, has confessed to his role in the crimes. The community of Boulder City can finally begin to heal, knowing that justice has been served. As we close this chapter, we remember Janice Clay, whose dedication to the truth brought light to the darkest corners of our town.

Tell me your secrets, Boulder City, and let the truth set you free.

With the evidence gathered by Jessy and the information from Alvin, Mr. Mysterious was able to expose Sheriff Thomas as the true mastermind behind the murders.

Sheriff Thomas has been arrested, and Mitchell Wade, now a broken man, has confessed to his role in the crimes. The community of Boulder City can finally begin to heal, knowing that justice has been served. As we close this chapter, we remember Janice Clay, whose dedication to the truth brought light to the darkest corners of our town.

A Final Revelation

Dear readers, it is with a heavy heart that I write this final entry. The loss of Janice Clay, our beloved Miss Mystery, has left a void in our community and in our hearts. Her dedication to uncovering the truth and her passion for justice were unparalleled. As we close this chapter, I feel it is my duty to share one last secret, one that has haunted me since the beginning of this column.

You see, I am not just Mr. Mysterious. I am also the anonymous source who provided the information about Megan Grace's murder and Alvin Green's involvement. I was there that night in 1991, hiding in the shadows, too afraid to come forward. I saw the dark pickup truck with the busted tail light and the dented door. I saw Megan's lifeless body being loaded into the truck. And I saw the face of the man who did it.

It was Mitchell Wade.

For years, I kept this secret buried, fearing the repercussions. But when Alvin Green confided in me, I knew I couldn't stay silent any longer. I fed the information to Miss Mystery, hoping she would bring justice to Megan and Alvin. But I never anticipated the killer would strike again.

When Jessy May Wade went missing, I knew Mitchell was tying up loose ends. And when Janice was found dead, I realized he was coming for anyone who knew the truth. I have been living in fear, but I can no longer remain silent.

Mitchell Wade is the murderer. He killed Megan Grace, Alvin Green, and Janice Clay. He is a dangerous man, and he must be stopped. I urge the authorities to act swiftly and bring him to justice before more lives are lost.

To the readers of Boulder City, thank you for your support and for sharing your secrets. It is time for me to disappear, but I leave you with this final truth. Stay vigilant, stay safe, and never stop seeking justice.

Goodbye, Boulder City.

Yours truly,
Mr. Mysterious"," Hey there, have a great day!""

“Yeah, Edmund, headlights can barely pick out the bends before they appear on this stretch, slow it down.”

“You’re going to slam us into a tree, or a herd of sheep, or a big pile of shitty manure if the smell around here is anything to go by. Put the window up, Edwin, it stinks!”

“Could you all shut up? It’s fine, I do this drive all the time, you know that.”

“Yep, some of us more than others. You don’t have to go so fast though. It's not like speed makes a difference.""

“Not to you, Cara. But I have to finish up and be home before she gets back. I only get one night a month to sneak out and…practice. You don’t know what she’s like. Domineering bitch. Doesn’t ever want me having fun.”

“Mommy dearest figuring out you took her car without permission will be the least of your problems if it ends up in a ditch with you dead inside it, Edmund. Come on, ease off the speed, okay?” 

“Did you just say ‘herd of sheep’, Synth? You do know it’s ‘flock’, right?” 

“Oh, really, Bethany? Gosh I’m sooo sorry about my inferior knowledge of what to call groups of smelly animals. Maybe you should flock off back to your herd of preppy assholes.”

“Watch the tone, Synthia. Beth is just…being Beth.”

“Thank you, Cara. I appreciate that.”

“‘Beth is just being Beth.’ Yeah, and there’s only so much of Bethany ‘I’m so cute and cuddly everyone cherish me please’ McConnell I can take. Don’t know how you put up with it, Cara. I’ve only had to deal with it for a few weeks, you’ve had months, right?”  

“Give it a rest, Synthia. Wouldn’t do you any harm to pick up a few social niceties from our Beth. Maybe in time she’ll teach you how to mellow.”

“And pigs might fly out of her ass. Speaking of which, why don’t you crawl up into it a bit more since you seem to like the smell of her shit. Oh, now I know what that smell is. I take it back, Edwin, open the window again, please.”

“That’s disgusting, Synth. What the flip is wrong with you? My ass does not stink. My ass smells like roses and hyacinth.”

“Girls, I’m not going to say it again - shut the hell up. You’re annoying the crap out of me.”

“Well, that’s what you get when you decide to pack a load of annoying girls into your mother’s car and joyride, Edmund. Deal with it.”

“Stop calling me that, Cara. And Synthia, don’t call me Edwin. It’s Ed. Alright. Just Ed. Or Eddie. Beth here can remember, why can’t you?”

“Except it’s not though, right, Ed? It’s short for something. I thought it was Edison but Cara told me once it was something else. What was that again? Eduma or Edan or…”

“Jesus! Watch out!”

“Eeeeeek! Flippity flip flops!”

“Fuckballs! Christ on a bike, Edwin, what the hell was that? Who do you think you are, Vin Freaking Diesel? Stop taking turns like that, I’m actually going to puke.”

“You won’t puke, Synthia. Don’t be ridiculous. Will you seriously all calm down. You’ve all done this trip with me before. Did I ever go off the road or hit anything? Did I ever lose control of the car? No. But I might just tonight if you all keep screeching.”

“Sorry to be the voice of dissent, Edmund, but I distinctly remember you hitting something on this road. A badger or a fox or…something with lots of legs. Roadkill, remember? That’s what you called it.”

“Doesn’t count, Cara.”

“Sure. Because you didn’t get out and do the thing.”

“And there was that other night, when it was just me and you, Ed, that guy on the motorbike you almost hit. I actually peed myself a little. TMI. But You were like ‘oh, that f’ng psycho, that crazy s.o.b, tearing along in the middle of the night, all over the road like he owns it’. That was scary, Ed. And you were driving crazy too. Just like…wooahh…now. I think Synth’s right, I might puke too.” 

“Nobody’s going to puke. And there’s nothing wrong with my driving. That’s one thing Mother does let me practice. Ad nauseum.”  

“You almost flipped Mommy’s car that time, Edmund. Maybe you’re practising wrong.”

“I didn’t almost flip the… Stop calling me… Oh my God, why are you all so annoying? Why do you all tag along if you hate this so much? Nobody asked you to. You don’t have to be here. It’s supposed to be just me and Mags.”

“Well, aren’t you lucky we are here, considering what a monumental bore she turned out to be. Can’t handle her drink at all. Hey, Mags, wakey wakey, you’re missing out on all the excitement. What about her, Edwin? Can she puke? All over Mommy’s clean car?”

“I actually don’t know how she’s sleeping through this. How much did she drink? Are you sure she’s okay back there? Have you tried poking her? Or giving her a shake?”

“Don’t touch her. Nobody touch her.”

“Don’t think it matters how much she drank, Beth.”

“Yeah, but I’m worried about her, Cara. Just give her a little shake, for me?”

“I said don’t touch her. Cara. Cara, don’t you…”

”Mags? Hey, Mags, can you hear me? Can you open your eyes?”

“Goddamnit, nobody listens.”

“Fuckballs, is she even alive? I don’t know how to check for a pulse. Which is better, neck or wrist?”

“She’s alive, Synthia. Of course she is. Mags? Mags, are you okay?”

“Here, let me give her a trademark Synthia Slap and…”

“I swear to God, girls, if you touch her again I’ll stomp on the gas and then you’ll really have something to scream about. Maybe you will puke, every one of you!”

“Okay, Ed, I’m sorry. That’s my bad. Guys, it’s okay, we can just let her sleep until...”

“Until nothing. I told you she wasn’t cut out for one of your parties, Edwin. As soon as she got in the car, I knew. Scared little rabbit in the headlights. Another Bethany, but worse, because she keeps her dainty legs shut. She’s not your type, I don’t know what you were thinking.” 

“I didn’t know, did I? She seemed…fun. We all make mistakes, Synthia. You could argue I made one with you.”

“What do you mean, ‘she keeps her legs shut’? Are you implying I’m some kind of slut, Synth?”

“No, Bethany. Slut-shame? Me? Ha. I’m implying Miss Mags here is some kind of prude. Definitely not what you’d call fun.”

“Fun like us, you mean? Until Edmund had his fill and got what he wanted. His practice.”

“Yeah, I know, Cara, I’m a real dick, so I ask again, why are you hanging around?”

“Believe me I’d rather be anywhere else. And I’m starting to think I could be. I don’t need to do this anymore. I think I’m about ready to stop.”

“I’d like to stop too. Can we just…finish the drive and go home? You know where Mags lives, Ed, right? I don’t want you just leaving her somewhere random in that state.”

“I know where she belongs, Beth, don’t worry.”

“Well it better not be too far out of the way. Where even are we now? It’s so dark, I can’t see shit. The stupid moon doesn’t even show its face in this sheep-shit neck of the woods. Shouldn’t we be off this road and onto the one with the…”

“There! That’s the turn, I remember! Slow down, here comes the sign!”

“I see it, Beth. For God’s sake, how many times… I know where I’m going, you don’t have to tell me where to turn!”

“Calm the…Jesus! Calm the hell down, Edmund, I’m serious! Even for you this is crazy. Are you actually trying to crash? Is that how you want this to end?”

“OMG, did you guys see what it said on that sign? ‘Ed Bumps’! Are you serious? Haha! It’s the funniest thing. It’s tailor made for you, Edwin!”

“Yeah, that’s what I meant, the sign. Don’t you remember seeing it before? So funny!”

“Why would I remember seeing it before?”

“Was funny the first time, Beth. Not anymore.”

“Aw, where’s your sense of humour, Cara? To be honest it looked more like ‘D Bumps’ this time, the bushes are getting really wild.”

“It’s supposed to say Speed Bumps, right? Why would there even be speed bumps out here? Did you put that there, Edwin? For fun?”

“Let it go, Synthia. Here comes the first one. Edmund… Please. Don’t go over it too…”

THUNK.

KA-TCHUNK!

AAAARRGGGHHHH!

“Holy fuckballs!”

“What the flip was that? Was that a scream?”

“Thank you, Edmund. Thank you so much.”

“Fuck me twice. Did we hit someone?”

“What? No we didn’t hit someone, Synthia. Was just the bump. The bump in the road.”

“Oh God. Ed. The scream. How did I forget about the scream…”

“I have no idea, Beth, after the fuss you made the last time. And I still don’t know what you’re hearing. ”

“Edmund. Slow down.”

“Why did…what was that scream? Cara? You heard that, right?”

“We know Beth did, so I guess I did too.”

“The scream. I think I blocked it out. Oh no. There’s another one coming, isn’t there? I’m so glad we didn’t wake Mags. She doesn’t need to hear this.”

“Edmund. Ed. Please.”

“Can’t do it, Cara, I’m behind schedule. Mother will be home before dawn. Really don’t understand why you all have to hear these screams. You out of everyone should be used to this. You’ve done this trip the most.”

“You don’t have to remind me. But forgive me for being…”

THUNK.

KA-TCHUNK!

EEEAAAGHHHH!

“-ugh-traumatised by the sound of screaming road bumps.”

“Fuckballs. I don’t like it. I feel weird. Stop, Edwin. I don’t want to hear any more.”

“Close your eyes, Synthia. It’s nearly over. Then you can forget it and go back to being sarcastic.”

“Beth? Are you okay?”

“No, Cara. I… I remember. The screams. I… I think that last one was… Oh no. Oh God. Why do the speed bumps scream?”

“Don’t start crying again, Beth! Why do you always have to sit up front where I can see you? They’re just bumps in the road and you’re over the worst so stop. I swear to God, I know you pride yourself on being the nicest, sweetest girl in the whole damn bunch but it makes me sick to my stomach so quit it with the tears and…”

“Shit, there’s another one! Stop the car, Edwin. Stop the car and let me out. Don’t go over it. I don’t want to go over that…”

THUNK.

KA-TCHUNK!

AIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!

“Noooooo! I can’t, I can’t, I can’t. Just stop the car and let me out!”

“Shut up, Synthia! It’s over, okay? Nobody asked you to be here, it’s your own fault so you’ll have to put up with it!”

“Nonono I don’t want to know I don’t want to be here let me out!!”

“Synthia! Look at me. Calm down! Take a breath and calm down!”

“Don’t tell her to calm down, Cara! She’s a horrible B and I don’t really like her but I know exactly how she feels. So do you, but you’ve had more time to get used to it. Not her. Not me. And what about Mags, how do you think she’s going to feel when…”

“Alright, that’s enough!”

SCREEEEEEEE–!

“Oww! Jeez, Ed, don’t stomp the brakes like that. You almost put me through the flipping…”

“Fuck. Wait. I’m sorry. Edwin, I’m sorry. You can keep driving. Okay? You can start back up and keep driving. Just get us off this evil road.”

“No. You wanted me to stop, fine, here we are, stopped in the middle of nowhere. Happy? It’s just where I want to be anyway. Now keep your mouths shut while I finish up.”

KA-CHUK.

“Edmund, stay in the car… you don’t have to do this. You don’t need to make another…”

CH-CHUNK.

“Edwin, you can leave her. She’s alive, you can drop her off somewhere and…”

“Get out of my way, Synthia. And stay back, Cara. Beth, don’t you even dare look at me with those…yeah, that’s right keep those pretty eyes shut and those manicured fingers in those ears, pretend it isn’t happening, like before. You all chose to be here. Obviously, you all need to see it. Again and again, for some reason. So just sit there and shut up while I practice.”

“Sure, Edwin. Whatever you say. Just take us home when it’s over.”

“Nnng. You could…uff…you could have stayed ‘home’ if you wanted to, Synthia. I don’t know why you didn’t. I don’t need you tagging along. Complaining about non-existent screams. I don’t need any of you. Now shut your gob and wait there.”

KA-CHUNK.

“Yeah, I’ll shut my gob and wait here, wait until you get yours. Asshole.”

“Stop it, Synthia. Just…stop…”

“Why, Cara? Because I can’t do anything about it?”

“Yes, right, exactly right. You can’t do anything about it. None of us can. All we can do is sit here in this Hell-car and watch. Until we don’t need to see it anymore. And I don’t. This is the last time for me. I’m done.” 

“I don’t want to see it anymore either, Cara. I remember what happened, with…um…. And now I’m going to see it again… That’ll be enough…won’t it?”

“I don’t know, Beth. For me it looks like three times is the charm but… Look, just sit tight and keep your eyes shut. If you don’t want to see you don’t have to. Maybe just being here’s enough..”

“He took Mags, right?”

“Yes, he did.”

“And she was alive, right? You said she was alive.”

“I wish she wasn’t. I wished you and Synthia weren’t either.”

“Sure, Cara. Why would a Northsider like you give a shit about me? I saw the way you looked at me when I got here. I could hear you judging from the start.”

“That wasn’t judgement, Synthia. That was despair. I saw it happen to Beth. I knew what was coming. But I couldn’t help you. And I can’t help Mags now either.”

“What’s he doing? To Mags. Oh God. Should I look?”

“Up to you.”

“He’s trying to wake her. He has her standing. Just about. Oh, no. She went down. But she’s moving, trying to sit up.”

“Oh God. Can she run? Can somebody tell her to run?”

“She can’t run, Beth. Could you?”

“She’s…trying to back away. He’s standing over her with his arms outstretched and…what the fuck?! What the fuck’s that on his head?”

“You’ll remember.”

“What’s what on his head? Oh. Oh no. I… I think I know what you…”

“Fuckballs. Is that… Are those… Is this what happened to me?”

“This is what happened to us.”

“Oh God. Oh God, it is. I remember now.”

“What’s…what’s happening to her? I feel like I should know but…explain?”

“I remember! I remember what it felt like turning to…”

“Cara, what the fuck is happening to Mags?! What’s happening to her skin?”

“Somebody help her, can somebody help her, can we...”

AAAIEEEEEEEEGGHH!!!

“No! Cara! No no no Not again! We have to help!”

“Nobody can help her, Beth. We can only help ourselves, by coming to terms with it.”

“Coming to terms with what? What the shit’s happening, Cara? He’s… She’s… It’s like she’s melting into the road or turning to… Oh. Oh.”

","

“What…? Where am I?”

“Jesus, what the fuck?”

“Oh my God! Mags? You…you’re here? Already? Oh, Mags, I’m so, so sorry…”

“What…is going on? Who are you people?”

“Welcome to the joyride. I’m Cara. Blondie beside you is Synthia. And that’s our lovely Bethany in front. Sorry it’s a bit cramped back here. I’ll be gone soon and you can spread out.”

“What? I don’t understand. We were on the beach, we had a fire and blankets, the moon and… Wait. Where’s Eduardo?”

“Eduardo? Are you serious? Hahaha. That’s a new one.”

“What’s so funny? What work? Is that him out there? What’s he doing stamping on the road?”

“He’s a big fan of speed bumps. You’ll see.”

“What? Seriously, who are you guys? How did I get here?”

“We’re sorry, Mags. We’re so, so sorry we couldn’t help.”

“Holy fuckballs. Snakes.”

“He’s coming back. I think I’m ready to go.”

“Are you all high? Okay, I don’t care, just let me out.”

“You can’t get out, Mags. I’m sorry.”

“It was snakes.”

“I’m going guys. I can feel it. Tell dear Edmund ‘screw you’.” 

“Edmund?”

“That’s what he was to me. Not Eduardo. Or Edwin. Or Edison. But none of those are really his name. I heard him say it once, when I came back. Before he noticed me. Before he knew this was a thing. I’ll tell you it, before I go. Because he hates it. His mother had a silly sense of humour. Named him after their ancestor. Maybe you can use it to taunt him.”

“Flip, Cara, I can barely see you. You’re really going!”

“I think my drink must have been spiked...”

“Fuck, guys...”

“His name…”

“Speak up, Cara. We can barely hear you anymore.”

“Eduardo? Eduardo! Come over here!”

“The things on his head...”

“His real name…” 

“Hurry, Cara, say it!”

“Who are these crazy bitches in your car?”

“The things on his head were snakes!”

“His real name’s Medusa.

“Minus the M.”  ","“Oh God, I remember now. It’s like she’s becoming part of the road. Just like we did.”

“Exactly, Synthia. We’re all part of this road. We’re the bumps. We’re the screams.”

“Wait, what? No, that can’t be right. I’m here, I’m in the car, I’m not…”

“Think, Beth. Think about the last time you were here. The last time you felt alive. The last time you felt anything.”

“I… I can’t… I don’t…”

“Beth, you’re not alive. None of us are. We’re echoes, memories. We’re trapped here, reliving this night over and over.”

“No, that’s not true! I’m real! I’m here!”

“Look at your hands, Beth. Look at your skin. It’s fading, isn’t it? Just like Mags’ is now.”

“Oh God, no. No, no, no! This can’t be happening!”

“It’s happening, Beth. It’s been happening. We’re all part of this cursed road. Edmund’s mother, she’s a witch. She cursed us all. Every month, he brings someone new, and we relive this nightmare.”

“But why? Why would she do this?”

“Power. Control. She feeds off our fear, our pain. And Edmund, he’s her puppet. He doesn’t even know what he’s doing. He thinks he’s just practicing his driving, but he’s feeding the curse.”

“So, we’re just… stuck here? Forever?”

“Not forever. There’s a way out. But it’s not easy.”

“What is it? Tell me, Cara, please!”

“We have to break the cycle. We have to stop Edmund from bringing anyone else. We have to make him see the truth.”

“But how? He won’t listen to us. He can’t even see us.”

“There’s one way. One chance. When he’s out there, with Mags, we have to reach him. We have to make him remember.”

“Remember what?”

“Remember who he really is. Remember what he’s done. If he can see the truth, the curse will break.”

“Okay. Okay, I’ll try. We’ll all try.”

“Good. Now, let’s do this. For Mags. For all of us.”

The three girls, their forms flickering like shadows, stepped out of the car and approached Edmund. He was standing over Mags, his eyes glazed, his hands trembling. They reached out, their ghostly fingers brushing against his skin.

“Edmund,” Cara whispered. “Remember.”

“Edmund,” Synthia echoed. “See the truth.”

“Edmund,” Beth pleaded. “Break the curse.”

Edmund’s eyes widened, his breath hitching. For a moment, he seemed to see them, to recognize them. And then, with a shudder, he collapsed to the ground, the curse shattering around them.

The road was silent. The bumps were gone. The screams were no more.

And the girls, finally free, faded into the night, leaving only the memory of their sacrifice behind.","<brainstorm>
1. **Supernatural Element**: The ""practice"" Ed refers to could be a ritual that involves sacrificing people to some dark entity or force. The screams from the speed bumps could be the souls of previous victims trapped in the road.
2. **Psychological Twist**: The entire scenario could be a shared hallucination or a psychological experiment. The characters might be in a controlled environment where their fears and memories are manipulated.
3. **Time Loop**: The characters could be stuck in a time loop, forced to relive the same night over and over until they figure out how to break the cycle.
4. **Revenge Plot**: One of the characters, possibly Cara, could be orchestrating the entire event as revenge against Ed for something he did in the past.
5. **Alien Abduction**: The road and the events could be part of an alien experiment, with the characters being observed and manipulated by extraterrestrial beings.

Best Idea: **Supernatural Element**. This idea provides a clear explanation for the screams and the ""practice"" Ed is referring to. It also allows for a dramatic and eerie twist that recontextualizes the entire story.

<ending>
As the girls watched in horror, Mags' body seemed to meld into the road, her skin turning to a dark, tar-like substance. The screams grew louder, echoing in the night air, as if the very ground beneath them was alive and in agony.

Ed stood over Mags, his face illuminated by the eerie glow of the moonlight. He wore a twisted smile, a grotesque mask of satisfaction. ""You see,"" he said, his voice calm and almost reverent, ""this is my practice. This is what Mother taught me.""

Cara's eyes widened in realization. ""Your mother... she wasn't just domineering, was she? She was something else. Something... dark.""

Ed nodded. ""She was a priestess of the old ways. The road, these bumps, they're not just bumps. They're markers. Each one represents a soul sacrificed to the ancient entity that grants us power. The screams you hear are the souls trapped in eternal torment.""

Bethany clutched her head, tears streaming down her face. ""Why us? Why did you bring us here?""

""Because,"" Ed replied, ""the ritual requires witnesses. The more people who see, the stronger the bond with the entity. And you all came willingly, didn't you? Driven by your own curiosity, your own need to understand.""

Synthia's face twisted in rage. ""You're a monster, Ed. A fucking monster.""

Ed shrugged. ""Perhaps. But I'm a monster with power. And now, Mags will join the others, her soul bound to the road, her screams a testament to my practice.""

Cara took a deep breath, her mind racing. ""No, Ed. This ends now.""

Before Ed could react, Cara lunged at him, knocking him off balance. The girls joined in, their combined strength overwhelming him. They dragged him to the edge of the road, where the ground seemed to pulse with a dark energy.

""Let the road take him,"" Cara said, her voice steady. ""Let him join his victims.""

As they pushed Ed onto the road, his screams joined the chorus of the damned. The ground swallowed him, his body dissolving into the dark, tar-like substance.

The girls stood in silence, the night air heavy with the weight of what they had done. The screams faded, leaving only the sound of the wind rustling through the trees.

""It's over,"" Cara said, her voice barely a whisper. ""It's finally over.""

They turned and walked away, leaving the cursed road behind, knowing they would never forget the night they faced the darkness and won.

</ending>","
As the girls watched in horror, Mags' body seemed to meld into the road, her skin turning to a dark, tar-like substance. The screams grew louder, echoing in the night air, as if the very ground beneath them was alive and in agony.

Ed stood over Mags, his face illuminated by the eerie glow of the moonlight. He wore a twisted smile, a grotesque mask of satisfaction. ""You see,"" he said, his voice calm and almost reverent, ""this is my practice. This is what Mother taught me.""

Cara's eyes widened in realization. ""Your mother... she wasn't just domineering, was she? She was something else. Something... dark.""

Ed nodded. ""She was a priestess of the old ways. The road, these bumps, they're not just bumps. They're markers. Each one represents a soul sacrificed to the ancient entity that grants us power. The screams you hear are the souls trapped in eternal torment.""

They turned and walked away, leaving the cursed road behind, knowing they would never forget the night they faced the darkness and won.

","“Yeah, Synthia. You’re remembering now, aren’t you? It’s the same thing that happened to you. And to me. And to Beth. We all went through it. We all became part of the road.”

“Part of the road? What the hell are you talking about, Cara? I don’t understand. I don’t want to understand.”

“You will, Synthia. You will. It’s the curse. Edmund’s curse. He’s bound to this road, and so are we. Every month, he has to bring someone new. Someone who’ll join us. Someone who’ll become part of the road.”

“No, no, no! This can’t be happening. This isn’t real. It’s just a nightmare. I’ll wake up and…”

“You won’t wake up, Synthia. None of us will. We’re trapped here. Forever. Watching him bring new victims. Watching them scream as they become part of the road. Just like we did.”

“Oh God. Oh God, no. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to see this. I don’t want to remember.”

“It’s too late, Synthia. You’re already part of it. We all are. And now, so is Mags.”

“Please, Cara. There has to be a way out. There has to be something we can do.”

“There isn’t. We’re stuck here. Forever. Until someone breaks the curse. But that’s not going to happen. Not as long as Edmund keeps bringing new victims.”

“Why? Why does he do it? Why does he keep bringing us here?”

“Because he’s cursed too, Synthia. He’s bound to this road, just like we are. He has to bring new victims, or he’ll suffer. He’ll feel the pain we feel. He’ll hear the screams we hear. He’ll become part of the road too.”

“No. No, I can’t accept that. There has to be a way to stop him. There has to be a way to end this.”

“There isn’t, Synthia. There’s nothing we can do. We’re just ghosts. Shadows. Echoes of who we used to be. We can’t change anything. We can’t stop him.”

“But we have to try. We have to do something. We can’t just sit here and watch him do this. We can’t just let him keep bringing new victims.”

“We don’t have a choice, Synthia. We’re powerless. We’re trapped. We’re part of the road.”

“No. I refuse to accept that. I refuse to give up. There has to be a way. There has to be something we can do.”

“Good luck with that, Synthia. But don’t get your hopes up. You’ll only end up disappointed. Just like the rest of us.”

As the last echoes of Mags’ scream faded into the night, Edmund returned to the car, a satisfied smirk on his face. He glanced at the girls, their expressions a mix of horror and resignation.

“Ready to go home, ladies?” he asked, his voice dripping with false cheerfulness.

None of them answered. They didn’t need to. They all knew the truth. They were already home. Forever bound to the cursed road, watching helplessly as Edmund brought new victims to join their eternal torment."," The scene is tense as the characters are forced to confront a horrifying reality they had hoped was never true. Beth and Cara watch in terror as Mags, under Edwin's control, struggles against an unseen force. Her body contorts, her skin changing before their very eyes - a transformation they fear but can no longer deny.

""We have to do something,"" Beth whispers urgently, desperation lacing each syllable. Cara remains silent for a moment too long, the weight of memory and horror settling heavy on her shoulders.

Finally, she turns away from the window, her voice steady despite the fear that grips them all: ""There's nothing we can do for her now,"" Cara says softly but firmly. ""We have to accept this as our reality.""

The car sits still in eerie silence except for the faint sounds of Mags struggling against an unseen force, and the distant hum of Edwin's relentless practice. As they watch their friend dissolve before them, Cara takes a deep breath: ""We can only hope that we never have to face this again.""

In the end, they all remain seated in silence as the night stretches on and Mags slowly disappears into nothingness - her skin melting away like wax left out under the sun.","f h z p"
"29",29," Ouroboros ",29,67,"6/1/2024","	“You want this?”

Devon Parker pulled a container from the inner pocket of his black leather jacket “I know you're following me. Consider yourself detected.”

The city street was sparsely lit by poorly maintained streetlights and obscured moonbeams. Down the street, a neon OUROBOROS sign flickered near the harbor.

“You’re still playing a game.” The young man in a white coat standing in the shadows shouted back.

“I know it’s a game. It’s a game you just lost.” Devon looked up scanning the buildings, light poles, and veneer surfaces for hidden cameras. “I don’t know what you think you're doing, but you should try harder. You’ve been following me for a while now. You might as well hand over your clue.” Impatiently Devon waved his arms signaling for a moderator to come forward and arbitrate as was custom. The young man didn’t make any effort to surrender a clue. “Fine, we’ll just wait for an official to eliminate you from the game.”

“You don’t understand, I am an official.” The man in the coat cautiously tried to approach, but Devon returned the case to his inner pocket and calculated evasive action. There was no way this player would trick him out of his clue.

Where are they? The moderators must be out to lunch and this player is trying to take advantage. With inevitable cyclic urgency, thoughts of his eleven-year-old son Brian returned. Tragically Brian had been stricken with a rare yet curable type of Leukemia. Devon could not afford the necessary treatment but winning the game’s half-a-million-dollar prize was how he could save his son’s life. In his mind losing was not an option.

Without another thought, he bolted off into a nearby alley, leaped onto a dumpster, and from the dumpster jumped up onto a nine-foot-high gate. He traversed across the gate until he squared himself with a concrete awning. Once he pulled himself up, he could reach the bottom of a fire escape ladder. When he glanced back, he noticed the man in the white coat entering the alleyway. He stopped climbing the ladder and deliberately quieted his breathing pattern. The man in the white coat looked up in his direction but in the dim alleyway, Devon was merely another shadow. Once the man in the white coat exited the alleyway Devon returned climbing the fire escape.

Dammit, I lost my mark, and this guy is still hot on my tail! Devon lamented to himself as he continued to ascend the ladder. His mark Rowan was the person he was assigned to follow in the game.

The game was structured in a circular chain. He was assigned to follow someone: his mark, who in turn was assigned to follow someone else, and so on in a circle of espionage. The last person in his chain was the person following him like a snake eating its tail. Each person in the circle holds a single clue. The only way to appropriate the clue from your mark is by spying, stealing, or tricking them to reveal their clue. The only way to get eliminated from the circle is to have your clue captured by another player or to get caught trying to capture someone else's clue.

When someone is caught, a moderator would intervene to eliminate them from the circle thus consolidating the clues into a smaller circle. The first player to acquire the most clues would have enough puzzle pieces to find the key and the box containing the half-a-million-dollar prize.

Devon ascended thirty stories to the rooftop of the city building. The moon shone down reflecting on puddles gathered in the recesses of the tar-covered roof. From the north side, he had an overview of the dark alleyway from which he rose. He walked to the eastern edge overlooking Ritenour Street. The street was eerily vacant. Aside from the moonlight, only a few random streetlamps and flickering neon signs illuminated the once-bustling street. Why is it so quiet? How can they film all of this with so little light? He wondered.

Devon knew that thousands of spectators around the country watched Ouroboros from the comfort of their living rooms, man caves, and barstools. But he only cared about one spectator, his son. His son Brian was rooting for him. He knew that with the advantage of his more objective perspective, he may be privy to crucial insights that Devon could not see. In desperation, he closed his eyes and tried to communicate with him psychically. Where is Rowan? Why can’t I remember where I last saw her last? Devon had to find his mark if he wanted to have any chance of winning the game.

In the west, Devon heard the distant sound of a dog bark echo crisply between the buildings, followed by a loud hum. He ran to the western edge and caught a fleeting glimpse of a bright magnesium flash quickly dissipating and a lone man who seemed to be looking up at him. He couldn’t make out the details from so high but assumed the man was his stalker in the white coat. He briskly stepped back from the edge so as not to be seen.

It seemed the game was winding down, but he knew Rowan was still on the prow. Rowan is an exceptional player; she’s probably consuming her marks like Pacman pellets. All I need to do is defeat her to win the game.

At the center of the top of the building, there was an egress with a doorway that should lead to the building’s interior. Devon decided to go and test the door to see if it was open. To find Rowan he would need to do some sleuthing. His memories of the countless hours he spent tracking Rowan were somehow diminished. Upon recollection, only vague, partially disintegrated confabulations came to light. Most of his recollections were of encounters with his stalker in the white coat. He put his hand on the door handle and twisted it. It was open. A distant voice caught his ear. A woman was crying somewhere near the south end. Quickly he ran to the south end of the rooftop edge and scanned out over the harbor. The letters “SUROBOROU” accompanied the rippled reflections of the moon on the harbor water. Then he noticed a whimper from a fire escape balcony four floors below.

Devon entered the center egress door and descended four flights down the stairwell. He pushed open the emergency exit door which opened into a long hallway. The single door on the south-facing wall beckoned him. He twisted the knob and was surprised when it opened. The room was a vast, mostly empty dull grey warehouse with large windows facing the southern harbor. A sudden surge of Déjà vu set upon him.  I remember this room; I was here before. He heard another quiet whimper coming through the doorway of the fire escape balcony. He made his way through the exit. He saw the back of a woman contemplating the docks below, her body precariously leering off the edge. She emanated her distress into the night, inviting cold gusts of air from the harbor. Instinctively he spoke.

“Don’t do it.” His lips seemed to be moving without his will.

“I lost my mark.” Wailed the woman “It’s over.”

“It’s not over, it’s just a game.” More words came out unconsciously. “Who was your mark? Maybe I can help.”

The woman guffawed and slowly turned to look at Devon. He instantly recognized her.

“I tricked all my marks. The only one left is you.”

Devon felt his heart sink with defeat. She must have eliminated the other players. He and Rowan were two of the last players left, and he was that close to winning. At that moment a desperate thought entered his mind. She hasn’t won yet. I can still steal her clues. He reached into his inner pocket, pulled out the container with his clue, and handed it to her. Rowan didn’t move to receive the winning clue.

“We know what you’re planning to do next. Please, don’t do it this time. Break the cycle!” Came a voice from behind. Feeling ambushed, Devon turned quickly. Standing far across the room near the entrance. It was the young man in the white coat, “It’s over-don’t do it.”

“You know what I’m planning, huh? Tell me, what do I usually do right now?” Devon asked the young man in the coat.

“You wait for Rowan to approach you. Once she’s close enough, you grab her clue, run to the fire escape, and quickly try to descend the side of the building. As you hastily descend the fire escape you miscalculate a short jump and fall more than twenty stories.” The man paused. “Then you start the cycle all over again. This was a game but it’s not the game you think it is.”

Devon felt a rush of adrenaline flood his system. He was urgently compelled to try and steal Rowan's clue and run down the fire escape. But he slowed his reaction, just enough to realize what he wanted to do was exactly what the young man predicted. The man in the coat watched as the realization settled on Devon’s face.

“Think about it how else could I know exactly what you're about to think? You’re stuck in a loop. This is your chance to break the pattern.”

Devon still stood in the doorway to the fire escape. He turned back to see how Rowan was reacting to this information. Her holographic form flickered and then suddenly disappeared.

“This isn’t real...It’s not some stupid Reality TV competition, is it?”

“No, you were playing a game, but it was in Hyper-Reality not reality TV.”

“By Hyper-Reality you’re referring to the brand, you mean I’m in VR?” The young man in the white coat nodded confirmation. Devon scanned the room searching for some overlooked clue. He looked back at the balcony where Rowan had once stood.

“Where did she go?”

“I’m not sure, but it’s probably a good sign. To be honest, we never got this far before.”

“So, you don’t know what I will do next?”

“I don’t, but I hope you’ll at least hear me out.” The young man in the white coat carefully gestured to close the distance between Devon and himself. “Don’t worry, I don’t want your clue, and I’m not trying to get you eliminated. The game is over.”

“Rowan won?”

“Yes, Rowan won. She tricked all the other players and had more than enough clues to take the prize, but she waited for you. She was a completionist. She reveled in her cunning. She took pride in her effortless ability to deceive contestants, take their clues, and eliminate them. Rowan was a master. She didn’t play for the money she played because she enjoyed it.”

“When did the game end?” Devon asked with a slight quiver in his voice.

“You’ve been stuck in a VR coma loop for nine years. You keep reliving the last day before your defeat, futilely trying to prevent the inevitable. In the real world, your body is fed and cycled intravenously through your VR suite. Fortunately, your muscles have not atrophied because you are still moving and reacting to the game.”

Devon looked for something loose on the ground. He spotted scattered rusty chain links, nuts, bolts, and an old, opened lock. He picked the lock up and inspected it as if it held some freshly disinterred secret.

“Why don’t you just pull the plug, or remove me from the VR suit to get me out of this?”

“It's not that easy. Although rare, you’re not the first to get lost in a VR loop. Cutting the power to the VR causes a shock to the system. Often throwing the user into cardiac arrest, brain hemorrhage, or worse. The only way to safely extricate someone from a loop is to enter the VR and mentally prepare the user to initiate their transition back to physical reality.”Devon threw the lock as hard as he could into the massive harbor-facing window shattering it into countless shards. “For the last six years, I spent every day in here, following you. Trying to earn your trust, but you wouldn’t listen to me, you always run away. You thought I was playing the game; trying to take your clue.”

Devon picked a sharp shard of glass up and pierced his forearm. No blood exited the puncture. He pulled the container out of his pocket again and held it out.

“So, this is worthless…What do I do now?”

","

“Like I said Rowan didn't care about the money. After discovering that you got stuck in the game, she felt guilty for putting you in this VR coma. She gave all the money to Mom.” The young man in the white coat held out his hand, “You would not give up on me, now I’m glad I didn’t give up on you… Dad, please come home now.”
","The young man in the white coat took a cautious step forward, his eyes filled with a mixture of hope and trepidation. ""You need to trust me, Devon. We have to break the cycle together. You have to let go of the game and accept that it's over.""

Devon looked at the container in his hand, the symbol of his desperate quest to save his son. His mind raced, trying to reconcile the reality he had known with the truth he was now being told. ""But my son... Brian... I need to save him.""

The young man nodded, his expression softening. ""Brian is safe, Devon. He’s been waiting for you to wake up. The prize money was used to cover his treatment years ago. He’s healthy now, but he needs his father back.""

Devon’s heart pounded in his chest. Could it be true? Could Brian really be okay? He felt a surge of emotion, a mixture of relief and sorrow. ""How do I know you're telling the truth?""

The young man reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small, worn photograph. He handed it to Devon. It was a picture of Brian, older than Devon remembered, but unmistakably his son. Brian was smiling, holding a sign that read, ""Wake up, Dad. I miss you.""

Tears welled up in Devon’s eyes as he clutched the photograph. The reality of his situation began to sink in. He had been trapped in a loop, fighting a battle that had already been won. ""Brian... my boy...""

The young man in the white coat stepped closer, placing a reassuring hand on Devon’s shoulder. ""It’s time to go home, Devon. Close your eyes and focus on Brian. Let him guide you back.""

Devon took a deep breath, his mind filled with the image of his son. He closed his eyes and concentrated, feeling a strange sensation wash over him. The world around him began to blur and fade, the rooftop, the city, the game—all dissolving into nothingness.

When he opened his eyes again, he was lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by medical equipment. The room was bright, sterile, and real. He felt weak, but alive. And there, standing by his bedside, was Brian, now a young man, tears streaming down his face.

""Dad! You’re awake!"" Brian exclaimed, rushing to embrace him.

Devon’s heart swelled with joy as he held his son. ""Brian... I’m so sorry I was gone for so long.""

Brian shook his head, smiling through his tears. ""It doesn’t matter, Dad. You’re here now. That’s all that matters.""

As Devon looked into his son’s eyes, he knew that he had finally broken free from the cycle. The game was over, and he had won the most important prize of all—his family.","<brainstorm>
1. Devon realizes that the young man in the white coat is actually a future version of himself, trying to break the loop.
2. The container Devon holds is a key to a hidden memory that can help him break free from the VR loop.
3. The game was a psychological experiment to test human resilience and problem-solving under extreme conditions.
4. Rowan is an AI designed to keep Devon in the loop, and her disappearance signifies a malfunction or a breakthrough.
5. The VR loop is a metaphor for Devon's guilt and grief over his son's illness, and breaking the loop means coming to terms with his emotions.

Best Idea: The young man in the white coat is a future version of Devon, who has managed to break free from the loop and is now trying to help his past self do the same. The container holds a key to a hidden memory that can help Devon break free from the VR loop. This twist recontextualizes the earlier events and provides a satisfying resolution to the story.

<ending>
Devon stared at the container in his hand, feeling the weight of its significance. The young man in the white coat took a cautious step closer, his eyes filled with a mixture of hope and urgency.

""That container,"" the young man said, ""holds the key to a memory you've buried deep within your mind. It's the memory that can help you break free from this loop.""

Devon looked at the young man, a sense of familiarity washing over him. ""Who are you?"" he asked, his voice trembling.

The young man took a deep breath. ""I'm you, Devon. I'm a future version of you who managed to break free from this loop. I've been trying to reach you, to help you escape.""

Devon's mind raced, the pieces of the puzzle finally clicking into place. The young man's knowledge of his every move, the sense of déjà vu, Rowan's disappearance—it all made sense now. ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" Devon asked, his voice filled with a mix of anger and relief.

""I tried,"" the young man replied, ""but you were too focused on the game, too desperate to save Brian. You couldn't see beyond the immediate goal.""

Devon looked down at the container, his heart pounding. ""What's in here?"" he asked.

""A memory,"" the young man said. ""A memory of the day you first entered the VR loop. You need to confront it, to understand why you got stuck in the first place.""

With trembling hands, Devon opened the container. A small, holographic projection emerged, showing a scene from nine years ago. He saw himself, younger and more hopeful, entering the VR suite for the first time. He heard the doctors explaining the experimental treatment for Brian's leukemia, a treatment that involved immersing himself in a VR game to stimulate his brain and find a solution.

But something had gone wrong. The emotional weight of Brian's illness, combined with the stress of the game, had trapped Devon in a loop of his own making. He had been reliving the same day, over and over, unable to move forward.

Tears streamed down Devon's face as he watched the memory unfold. ""I did this to myself,"" he whispered. ""I couldn't let go.""

The young man in the white coat nodded. ""But now you can. You have the power to break free, to return to the real world and be there for Brian.""

Devon took a deep breath, feeling a sense of clarity and resolve. He closed his eyes and focused on the memory, allowing it to wash over him. He felt a shift, a release, as the loop began to unravel.

When he opened his eyes, he was no longer in the VR world. He was in a hospital room, surrounded by doctors and nurses. The young man in the white coat was gone, but Devon knew he had been real, a part of himself that had guided him to freedom.

""Welcome back, Mr. Parker,"" a doctor said, smiling. ""You've been through a lot, but you're finally free.""

Devon looked around, his heart swelling with hope. ""Where's Brian?"" he asked.

""He's right here,"" the doctor said, gesturing to a nearby bed. Brian, now a young teenager, looked up at his father with a smile.

""Dad,"" Brian said, his voice filled with emotion. ""You did it. You came back.""

Devon rushed to his son's side, tears of joy streaming down his face. ""I did it for you, Brian. I did it for us.""

As they embraced, Devon felt a sense of closure and peace. The game was over, and he was finally free to live his life, to be there for his son, and to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

Devon looked down at the container in his hand, the object that had consumed his every waking moment for what felt like an eternity. He felt a pang of sorrow for his son, Brian, and the desperate hope that had driven him to this point. But if this was all a lie, then Brian was still out there, waiting for him in the real world.

The young man extended his hand, and Devon took it. As they walked back through the warehouse and up the stairwell, the world around them began to shimmer and distort. The walls seemed to ripple like water, and the floor beneath their feet felt less solid with each step.

""Focus on your breathing,"" the young man instructed. ""In and out. Slow and steady. Imagine yourself waking up, feeling the weight of your real body, the air in your lungs.""

Devon closed his eyes and did as he was told. He could feel a strange sensation, as if he were being pulled in two different directions. The world of the game was trying to hold onto him, but the promise of reality was stronger.

""You're doing great,"" the young man said. ""Just a little further.""

They reached the rooftop again, and Devon could see the cityscape dissolving into a kaleidoscope of colors. The stars in the sky flickered and went out one by one, replaced by a growing darkness that seemed to envelop everything.

""Now, Devon,"" the young man said, his voice echoing as if from a great distance. ""Open your eyes.""

Devon took a deep breath and opened his eyes. The world of the game vanished, replaced by the sterile white walls of a hospital room. He was lying in a bed, tubes and wires connected to his body. The young man in the white coat was standing beside him, but now he wore a name tag that read ""Dr. Michael Harris.""

""Welcome back, Devon,"" Dr. Harris said, smiling warmly. ""You've been through a lot, but you're finally free.""

Devon felt tears streaming down his face as he looked around the room. There, sitting in a chair by his bedside, was Brian, now a young teenager. His eyes were filled with tears of joy and relief.

""Dad!"" Brian exclaimed, rushing to his side and hugging him tightly. ""I knew you'd come back. I never gave up on you.""

Devon hugged his son, feeling the warmth and reality of the embrace. ""I'm here, Brian. I'm here.""

As he held his son, Devon realized that the true prize was not the half-a-million dollars, but the chance to be with his family again. The game was over, and he had won something far more valuable: his life back."," Devon stared at the shard in his hand for a moment before he realized that it was not blood but some kind of virtual reality fluid that had seeped from his punctured skin—a sign, perhaps, that even within this simulated world, consequences existed.

“What if I don't want to return?” Devon asked the man in the white coat. He felt a strange mix of betrayal and relief at being finally set free, yet there was also a lingering fear about re-entering reality after years confined within this digital prison.

The young man nodded understandingly, his eyes softening with empathy as he replied, “It's natural to feel that way. The world has changed, but it hasn't abandoned you. There are still people who care about you.”

Devon swallowed the lump in his throat and asked again, ""So what now?""

“Now,” the man said with a reassuring smile, “you get to start anew. You can choose your next move, live out whatever life has left for you beyond these walls—free from the confines of this game.”

With that, Devon took one last look at his surroundings and felt the familiar sensation as he was gently pulled away from Hyper-Reality. He saw the room dissolve around him like a watercolor painting being washed in rain before finally slipping into darkness. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself lying on an unfamiliar bed within a brightly lit white room filled with medical equipment. A doctor and a nurse were busy monitoring his vitals.

""You're awake,"" the doctor said softly as Devon tried to sit up, wincing at the sudden pain in his arm from where he had pierced himself earlier. The young man in the white coat was there too, looking relieved and a bit sheepish. ""We were worried we wouldn't be able to get you out of that VR coma loop.""

Devon blinked slowly as he took it all in. He had finally returned home after years lost inside his own mind—the only reality he had ever known. The man in the white coat explained how Rowan, a brilliant coder who had developed this virtual world for her amusement, was eventually caught and charged with exploitation and fraud, leading to her downfall.

As Devon's body slowly regained its strength, so too did his spirit. He embarked on the journey of reintegration into society, learning that time outside the VR loop had moved forward but not without challenges. Technology advanced by leaps and bounds while he was trapped in his own mind—and now, it took him some time to catch up with all the advancebut also provided new opportunities for growth.

He started taking part-time jobs at a local café, where conversations around VR technology became commonplace. Devon's past experiences gave him an edge in understanding this emerging field, and he soon found himself employed as a programmer at a tech startup specializing in creating safe and ethical virtual reality environments.

As months turned into years, Devon established new connections with people who appreciated his unique perspective—people who had been touched by VR technology but understood the importance of boundaries and empathy. He even formed an unlikely friendship with one of Rowan's former colleagues, a woman named Elena, who shared stories about her work on virtual reality ethics and safety protocols.

As Devon began to rebuild his life piece by piece, he realized that the VR coma loop had not only robbed him of time but also given him an invaluable perspective on the human condition—the struggle between our desires for escape from harsh realities and the necessity of facing them head-on.

One day, years later, Devon found himself standing before a small audience at a conference dedicated to the ethical development of virtual reality technology. He took a deep breath as he began speaking about his experience in VR—not just for him but for everyone who had ever felt trapped by their own fears or circumstances.

""In this world, we have an incredible tool that can transport us into realms beyond our wildest dreams,"" Devon said with conviction, ""but let's remember to use it responsibly and never lose sight of what truly matters—the human connection.""","p f h z"
"30",30," The Circus Of Spies ",30,104,"5/30/2024","After hopping on the 38 bus I walk up the stairs to the upper deck and find an empty seat, two seats behind my target. I've been tailing this woman for about three weeks now. My name is Nathan Peterson. As a British MI5 agent for about five years, I've had various surveillance jobs in my time, and by far this particular assignment is the most interesting one I've had.

The woman in front of me in her blue raincoat and a red scarf around her neck is Margaret Jones. Twenty-two years old, born on 5th April 1932 in Swansea, Wales. Her parents moved to London later and evacuated her to Devon in 1940, just before the Blitz began in London. She moved back to London a few years ago.

 Right not far now, the bus will soon be at Piccadilly Circus. It always reminds me of the time my cousin, Richard, drove my sister Debra and me to London Airport to watch the planes take off and land. Richard asked us if we'd like to see the Circus on the way. Being about eight and nine years old and both naive– we thought we were going to see a real circus with big tent clowns and elephants. Still, we had a little adventure watching the planes taking off and landing.

Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, back to Miss Jones, apparently she is a bit of a mystery. You see, the real Margaret Jones wasn't evacuated at all … She was killed with her parents when their house was bombed on October 14th,1940! This lady has taken Margaret Jones’ identity and the big shocker… her real name is… Katerina Smirnova, a Russian spy!

Ah, here's our stop coming up as we come into Piccadilly Circus. The noise becomes deafening with hundreds of vehicles turning around the roundabout beeping their horn impatiently because they want to get home. They encircle the small island where Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain and the statue of Anteros are (usually mistaken for Eros).

Finally, Katerina gets off at her stop with me in hot pursuit. I follow her some twenty yards behind as we pass the various billboards of adverts such as the …red Coca-Cola sign and the Guiness big clock.  

Katerina now crosses the busy Circus road walking speedily towards Soho. I continue behind her as she makes her way to her usual haunt the Fox Nightclub. As she turns into the street I can hear jazz music in the background emanating from the Fox. Her boyfriend is waiting for her outside, she pecks him on the cheek and they both go into the Nightclub. 

Frustratingly I am unable to enter the club because you have to be a member. So I wait impatiently outside by a streetlight for them to come out. Normally after about an hour! 

It soon starts to rain and I put my Mackintosh collar up. Good on time, Michael my colleague parks up in his black Land Rover ready to pick me up so we can follow Katerina and her boyfriend. 

Soon at 9 o'clock, they both come out of the Nightclub. I jump in Michael's car and we follow them as they get a black cab. 

We've been doing this for weeks, tailing them to Islington to their local pub, The Standard.

Finally, they arrive at the pub and go inside. Both Michael and I walk into a blue-smoky, noisy pub. We get a beer and sit opposite the couple at their table smoking and drinking. Katerina giggles as she turns to her boyfriend. Across the table is a surprising figure. Someone I did not expect… It was Novikov Mikhailov, one of the KGB's top spies.

By 10 o'clock it was packed with people in the pub. Suddenly, Katerina got up looking a little tipsy. It's at this point she pretends to drop her packet of cigarettes. Then in the confusion, she secretes a canister of film into the other spy's coat pocket. This time it must be extremely valuable, for Novikov to be present!

Novikov then got up and said he had to go now. Shortly after, Katerina and her boyfriend left the pub too. Michael and I soon followed, observing the couple get into a black cab to go home. After following them home Michael and I called it a day. 

MI5 have been onto Katerina and her ring for some time. She is invaluable to the Soviets because she has been collecting dozens of British secrets by blackmailing politicians, civil servants and top military servicemen. 

 My Controller said to me recently:” Very soon MI5 will confront Katerina to turn her in!” In other words, work for us as a double agent!

We found this out when two MI5 agents checked her flat in Islington. There was a two-way mirror in her bedroom and they discovered an 8mm film canister. 

They raced it to the lab boys and made a quick copy of the film. And the two agents hurried back and placed it in the exact place they found it. So no one would be the wiser! Later the darkroom boys showed the film to Control my boss. It showed a general with Katerina in a compromising position on her bed.

The next day I continued following Katerina, to her usual haunts. Nothing to report. On the way back home in the evening, when I got off the bus a strange big, heavy man in a black overcoat came down the stairs. He stared at me and gave me the most evil grin. Afterwards, the man went over to a parked black, Ford Zephyr and spoke to the driver. Turned and looked back at me. Then they drove off. With all My years of surveillance, I know if someone is following me. And I'm sure this man was tailing me!

As I lay in bed I kept thinking about this odd man. How can the Russians be onto me? I haven't made anyone suspicious!

The next morning I got a phone call from Control. He told me he and Michael had visited Katerina earlier this morning after her boyfriend went out. She now works for MI5!

Today I'm going to follow her as usual. Now let's see: I've got my wallet, change, cigarettes, lighter and umbrella instead of wearing my hat today. For varying my disguise.Whoops! Nearly forgot, hopefully I won't need this!

“Going to work again Mr Peterson?” Asked my landlady Mary. Just as I opened the street door.

“ Yes, Mary, I'm going to have some fun at work today!” I said with a grin.

She looked at me for a second and giggled: ”Oh Mr Peterson, you're so funny! And shut the door.

I like Mary because she is so genuine and has a sense of humour. Unlike the nosey, biddy-body landladies I've had in the past.

Having got a bus to Victoria, I jumped on a 38 bus just after Katerina climbed upstairs. She sat at the front and I was two seats behind her.

 The journey went quite quickly as we soon came upon Piccadilly Circus. As usual, it became noisy with cars beeping everywhere as the bus turned on the Circus roundabout. We soon arrived at the bus stop. Just then people got out of their seats to go downstairs. Then Katerina was about to pass me but a strange thing happened. She glared at me with her blue eyes looking terrified! Dropping a scrunch-up piece of paper into my lap!

Katerina stepped off the bus and I followed her. She then crossed the busy Circus road and I continued walking some 50 yards behind her. We Passed by the numerous flashing neon adverts of the giant, red Coca-Cola billboard, Bovril, Sweppes, Max Factor and many other flashing signs. Finally, Katerina changed her usual route and walked instead, down the Soho red-light district.  

Walking through Soho I walked by numerous buildings with red lights on and some flashing to let punters know the girls were ready for business. Unbelievably, Soho and Piccadilly Circus have had a sex trade since 1778! Just a short distance away some scantily-dressed women are trying to entice randy men into their dens!

I make my excuses to turn down the girls trying to entice me into their webs. But this fly has more urgent things to attend to than lust. I continue following Katerina as she gets closer to the Fox Nightclub.

Just some fifty yards away I can hear the Nightclub's jazz music. I spot Katerina's boyfriend outside the club waving to Katerina. She waves back. They embrace and go inside the Nightclub. I'm standing by a wall lighting a cigarette as I wait as usual for the couple to come out. 

Just then I felt a raindrop on the back of my neck, and I looked up and saw raindrops coming down, lit up by the streetlight a few yards away. Pulling up my collar I realise I must've left my umbrella on the bus. Then I remembered the paper Katerina gave me. Pulling out the paper from my Mackintosh pocket and reading it it said:

 “They Know! Help!”

“Hello MI5 man!” said a gruff voice

I turned around and standing next to the streetlight was the stranger I had seen coming off the bus yesterday. His massive build had cast a giant, black shadow against the nearby brick wall.

My heart raced as he walked slowly towards me. 

“MI5 man don't worry I will not hurt you, I will be quick!’ The stranger said, speaking softly. Walking ever closer. 

Damn it! And they told me I shouldn't have a gun because it could compromise my cover! What about compromising me without a gun?

 By now it was p#####g!down. But getting soaked was the least of my worries.

“Oh f##k it!” I felt the b#####d's heavy hands now around my throat, as sweat poured from his brow. Just as life was ebbing away from me suddenly, I heard two thud-like sounds and smelt a waft of acetone and cordite. I saw the big man groan and grimace as he crashed to the ground dead in a puddle! Glancing down I saw a smoking, burnt hole in my coat pocket!

I had never killed anyone before but I'm relieved I did now. Luckily I sensed danger and borrowed the 9mm Browning from my Special Branch friend, Bill Casey!

My mind was in a twirl. I had to act fast before anyone came. I struggled to pull the body into a dark alleyway. He must've weighed a ton! 

Shortly after, Michael arrived and I told him to find a phone box and phone HQ to tell them about the body and that I think Katerina is in danger. He rushed back into his car and drove off to find a phonebox.

Meanwhile, I continued waiting for Katerina and her boyfriend to leave the Nightclub. I waited till 10 o'clock, then midnight. I guess somehow they left without me knowing. Maybe during the struggle with the Russian or during moving the body! Anyway, the club is closed now. 

I decided to get a cab home.

The next morning, Control phoned to tell me the cleaners had dealt with the body and not to worry about Katerina; she probably went back home with her boyfriend, during my struggle with the Russian. I was to keep an eye on her as usual today.

Later that day, I followed Katerina on the bus as usual. She was wearing the same, blue raincoat and her red scarf around her neck, sitting two seats in front of me. But there was something different about her. I just couldn't put my finger on it. A man in front of me opened his newspaper. He ignored the front page and started reading the sports section. Then he turned back to the front page just as we were going to turn into Piccadilly Circus. I then observed someone pull the cord to stop the bus. Passengers soon got up from their seats to get off at the next stop. It was then that my heart sank as I saw the man looking on the front page of his paper… There was a photograph of a woman… the spitting image of Katrina. The woman had been strangled! But it can't be Katerina, I thought because she is two seats in front of me on the bus!

Due to my delayed shock and a crowd of people walking past me, I missed Katerina passing by me and just spotted her going down the stairs. 

Just as I was about to go downstairs I heard a voice say: “And where do you think you're going, sir?” Said the bus conductor with a grin. He had just started giving tickets to people upstairs. He smirked at me as if I was one of those fare dodgers. Then wound up his ticket machine and gave me a ticket after I paid him.

After jumping off the bus I felt a steering pain run through my left ankle. I bent down and rubbed it and slowly walked to the edge of the curb to cross the road. Katerina had already crossed and I could see she was making her way to Soho. 

After crossing the Circus road, as usual, I went by the many flashing lights of the neon billboards of advertisements. 

Struggling with my painful ankle I carried on following Katerina down Soho. Again I could hear the jazz music emanating from the Fox Nightclub. Then Katerina suddenly stopped and waved to her boyfriend John as he came out of the club. They Met up, cuddled and went inside the building. I still could not discern if it was Katerina or not, the streetlights just weren't bright enough to see!

Michael was going to meet me again and we'd follow the couple to Islington.

An hour had passed when Michael drove up. I got in his Zephyr and … I noticed something wedged at the bottom of Michael's front seat… A red scarf!

","

“Nathan, Did you see Katerina?”

“Yes, I think so,” I replied.

 “What you're not sure, Nathan?

“No, I'm more certain now, than five minutes ago!”

“What do you mean?” 

 “ It was you, you killed Katerina didn't you, you b#####d! 

  “ You made one mistake, Michael, you forgot to get rid of her red scarf!”

“Look, she was a traitor to the Soviet Union, and I hate traitors! At that moment, Michael reached for his gun. A second later…Pop!Pop

Nathan fired two shots into Michael and he jolted back, against the dashboard.

“I too hate traitors, Michael, when they are traitors to Britain!

End","I reached down and pulled out the red scarf, my mind racing. How could Katerina's scarf be here when she was inside the nightclub? I turned to Michael, who was watching me with an unreadable expression.

""Michael, where did this come from?"" I demanded, holding up the scarf.

He shrugged nonchalantly. ""Must've fallen out of her bag last time we followed her.""

But something didn't add up. I had seen Katerina wearing the scarf just moments ago. My instincts screamed that something was terribly wrong. I decided to confront Michael directly.

""Michael, are you sure about that? Because I saw her wearing this scarf today.""

Michael's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, I saw a flicker of something—fear, perhaps? He quickly masked it with a forced smile. ""You're overthinking, Nathan. Let's focus on the mission.""

I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. As we waited for Katerina and her boyfriend to leave the nightclub, I replayed the events of the past few days in my mind. The strange man who had attacked me, the unsettling feeling that I was being watched, and now this scarf. It all pointed to one thing: a setup.

Finally, the couple emerged from the nightclub. I watched them closely, my heart pounding. They got into a black cab, and we followed them to Islington as usual. But this time, I was on high alert.

When we arrived at The Standard pub, I decided to test my theory. ""Michael, you go in first. I'll join you in a minute.""

He hesitated but then nodded and went inside. I waited a few moments before following him. As I entered the pub, I saw Michael sitting at a table with Katerina and her boyfriend. They were laughing and chatting as if nothing was amiss.

I approached their table, my eyes locked on Katerina. ""Mind if I join you?""

Katerina looked up, her eyes widening in surprise. ""Nathan, what are you doing here?""

I ignored her question and turned to Michael. ""Tell me, Michael, how long have you been working for the KGB?""

The table fell silent. Michael's face turned pale, and Katerina's eyes darted between us, confusion etched on her face.

""What are you talking about?"" Michael stammered.

I pulled out the red scarf and placed it on the table. ""This scarf was in your car, Michael. And I saw Katerina wearing it today. Explain that.""

Michael's facade crumbled. He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small pistol, aiming it at me. ""You're too clever for your own good, Nathan.""

Before he could pull the trigger, Katerina grabbed a beer bottle and smashed it over Michael's head. He collapsed to the floor, unconscious.

Katerina turned to me, her eyes filled with fear and relief. ""Nathan, you have to believe me. I didn't know he was a double agent. He must have planted the scarf to throw you off.""

I nodded, my mind racing. ""We need to get out of here. Now.""

As we left the pub, I couldn't help but feel a sense of betrayal. Michael, my trusted colleague, had been working for the enemy all along. But at least now, I knew the truth. And with Katerina by my side, we had a chance to turn the tables on the KGB.

As we walked into the night, I glanced at Katerina. ""You know, this might be the beginning of a beautiful partnership.""

She smiled, her eyes twinkling with determination. ""Let's take them down, Nathan. Together.""","<brainstorm>
1. **Double Agent Twist**: Katerina was never a Russian spy but was framed by someone within MI5. The real spy is Michael, who has been manipulating Nathan.
2. **Identity Swap**: The woman Nathan has been following is not Katerina but someone else entirely, possibly a decoy.
3. **Katerina's Plan**: Katerina is aware of Nathan's surveillance and has been feeding false information to MI5. She plans to defect to the British side but needs to eliminate the real threat first.
4. **Michael's Betrayal**: Michael is working with the Russians and has been using Nathan to get close to Katerina. The red scarf in Michael's car is a clue to his betrayal.
5. **Katerina's Death**: The real Katerina was killed, and the woman Nathan is following is her twin sister, who is trying to uncover the truth about her sister's death.

Best Idea: Michael's Betrayal. This twist will recontextualize earlier events, such as Michael's convenient appearances and the red scarf, and provide a satisfying resolution by revealing the true spy.
</brainstorm>

<ending>
As I sat in Michael's car, my mind raced. The red scarf wedged under the seat was unmistakably Katerina's. How did it get here? My thoughts were interrupted by Michael's voice.

""Everything alright, Nathan?"" he asked, his tone unusually calm.

""Yeah, just a bit tired,"" I replied, trying to mask my suspicion.

We followed the couple to Islington, but my focus was now on Michael. The pieces started to fall into place. Michael had always been conveniently present, always a step ahead. The red scarf, the body cleanup, the phone call from Control—everything pointed to him.

As we parked near the pub, I decided to confront him. ""Michael, I need to ask you something. How did Katerina's scarf end up in your car?""

Michael's eyes narrowed, and a cold smile spread across his face. ""You're sharper than I thought, Nathan. But it's too late.""

Before I could react, he pulled out a gun. ""You see, Katerina was never the real target. It was you. You've been getting too close to the truth.""

""Truth? What truth?"" I demanded, my heart pounding.

""Katerina was trying to defect to our side. She had valuable information about a mole within MI5. Me. I couldn't let that happen.""

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. Katerina's terrified look, the note—she was trying to warn me. ""You killed her,"" I said, my voice shaking with anger.

Michael shrugged. ""She was a liability. And now, so are you.""

Just then, the pub door opened, and Katerina and her boyfriend stepped out. I seized the moment, lunging at Michael and knocking the gun from his hand. A struggle ensued, but I managed to overpower him, pinning him to the ground.

Katerina rushed over, her eyes wide with shock. ""Nathan, are you alright?""

""Yes, but we need to get out of here. Michael's been playing us all along.""

As we drove away, Katerina explained everything. She had been gathering evidence against Michael, hoping to expose him. The film canister, the compromising photos—they were all part of her plan to bring him down.

In the end, Michael was arrested, and Katerina was granted asylum. The truth about the mole within MI5 was finally revealed, and I had a newfound respect for the woman I had been tailing. The case was closed, but the lessons learned would stay with me forever.

","My heart pounded as I reached down and pulled out the red scarf. It was unmistakably Katerina's. I turned to Michael, my mind racing with questions.

""Michael, where did you get this?"" I demanded, holding up the scarf.

Michael's face turned pale, and he stammered, ""I... I don't know, Nathan. I swear, I have no idea how it got there.""

I scrutinized his expression, searching for any sign of deceit. But Michael had been my colleague for years, and I had never known him to lie. Still, the presence of the scarf in his car was deeply unsettling.

""Let's go,"" I said, my voice tense. ""We need to follow them.""

We drove in silence, my mind replaying the events of the past few days. The photograph in the newspaper, the strange man on the bus, and now this scarf. Something wasn't adding up.

As we approached Islington, I saw Katerina and her boyfriend entering their local pub, The Standard. We parked a short distance away and followed them inside. The pub was crowded, the air thick with smoke and the hum of conversation. We found a table near the couple and ordered drinks, trying to blend in.

Katerina and her boyfriend seemed relaxed, laughing and chatting. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I glanced at Michael, who was nervously fidgeting with his drink.

""Michael, are you sure you don't know anything about the scarf?"" I asked again, my voice low.

He shook his head, looking genuinely bewildered. ""I swear, Nathan. I don't know how it got there.""

Just then, Katerina's boyfriend got up and headed to the restroom. Katerina took a sip of her drink, her eyes scanning the room. Our eyes met, and for a brief moment, I saw a flicker of recognition. She quickly looked away, but it was too late. She knew I was watching her.

I leaned in closer to Michael. ""We need to confront her. Now.""

We stood up and approached Katerina's table. She looked up, her expression a mix of surprise and fear.

""Katerina,"" I said, keeping my voice steady. ""We need to talk.""

She glanced around nervously, then nodded. ""Alright. But not here. Follow me.""

We followed her out of the pub and down a dimly lit alley. She stopped and turned to face us, her eyes wide with fear.

""They know,"" she whispered. ""They know everything.""

""Who knows?"" I asked, my heart racing.

""The KGB,"" she replied. ""They've been onto me for weeks. They know I'm working for MI5 now.""

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the man from the bus, the one who had tried to strangle me. He lunged at Katerina, but Michael was quicker. He pulled out his gun and fired, the shot echoing through the alley. The man fell to the ground, clutching his chest.

Katerina collapsed against the wall, sobbing. ""I thought I could handle it,"" she cried. ""But they're everywhere. I can't escape them.""

I put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. ""We'll protect you, Katerina. You're safe now.""

As we escorted her back to the car, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was far from over. The KGB was relentless, and they wouldn't stop until they had what they wanted. But for now, we had Katerina, and that was a victory in itself.

As we drove away, I glanced at Michael. ""Good job back there,"" I said.

He nodded, his expression grim. ""Let's just hope it's enough.""

We had won this battle, but the war was far from over. And as long as Katerina was with us, we would be ready for whatever came next."," As my eyes caught the sight of Katerina's boyfriend, John, inside the Fox Nightclub with a woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to Katerina in her blue raincoat and red scarf, I felt an icy dread grip my heart. The realization hit me like a freight train—the photograph on the front page of the newspaper wasn't just any woman; it was Katerina herself. But how could that be? She was right here in Soho with John.

My mind raced, trying to piece together what had transpired since last night when I thought everything would return to normal. It became clear that my interference might have saved me from the Russian's clutches but at a terrible cost—I feared for Katerina’s safety now more than ever.

Michael and I followed John and his companion, maintaining distance as they weaved through Soho, their movements seemingly innocuous yet tainted with an air of finality. The jazz music from the Fox Nightclub continued to float on the night breeze, a haunting melody that seemed out of place amidst our urgency.

The streets of London were now empty, save for the occasional late-night wanderer or dimmed shop sign, as we trailed them into Islington. I nursed my throbbing ankle and kept a vigilant eye on John's every move, knowing that time was slipping through our fingers like sand.

Hours passed with no further clues. The night had long turned to early morning when the first rays of dawn began to creep across the skyline. Michael and I were weary but relentless in our pursuit. We knew something sinister lurked beneath the surface, a truth that could unravel Katerina's fate—and possibly mine.

Just as the sun threatened to rise, John led his companion into an old Victorian building on a quiet side street. The door was slightly ajar, and we approached cautiously, our instincts screaming for us to be ready for anything. Michael handed me a small device that would allow us to listen from outside without being detected.

We pressed our ears against the cold wood of the entryway as muffled voices reached us—a mix of tension and something darker still, like secrets whispered in fearful anticipation. I exchanged a look with Michael; we had no choice but to confront whatever lay ahead. We readied ourselves for what could be the most perilous encounter of our careers or lives.

As I pushed open the door just enough to slip through, my heart pounded against my ribs like a caged bird desperate for escape. The room was dimly lit by the flickering glow of candles strategically placed around the space—a stark contrast to the vibrancy and life we associated with Katerina's world. At the center, in front of what appeared to be an altar adorned with symbols that made my skin crawl, stood John and his companion, facing a figure shrouded in shadow.

The man lifted his head as I stepped into view, recognition dawning on his face before he could conceal it. It was the Russian, alive and well—and Katerina was there too, unmistakably identified by her distinctive scarf. They were bound to something cold and metallic that seemed almost an extension of the walls themselves.

John's voice broke through my thoughts, ""Katerina, this isn't you!"" But it was clear he didn’t believe his own words as much as his eyes pleaded for mercy or perhaps absolution. The Russian smirked—a gesture that sent a chill down my spine more effectively than the night air ever could.

Without hesitation, I lunged forward with Michael at my side. But before we could reach them, alarms shattered the silence. A sudden rush of adrenaline coursed through me as I prepared to face not just a man but an entire web of deceit that had ensnared us all.","z p h f"
